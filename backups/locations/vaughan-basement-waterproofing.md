## Vaughan-Specific FAQ

**Q: How does Vaughan's clay soil affect my basement?**
A: Vaughan's clay expands when wet, putting extreme pressure on foundations. It also shrinks when dry, creating voids where water collects. This cycle causes more basement problems here than anywhere else in the GTA.

**Q: Do new homes in Vaughan need waterproofing?**
A: Yes, especially after 2-5 years when settling occurs and builder waterproofing fails. We see many Maple and Vellore homes needing upgrades within this timeframe.

**Q: What about Vaughan's high water table?**
A: Areas near the Humber and Don Rivers have extremely high water tables. We install specialized systems with high-capacity pumps and backup power to handle the volume.

**Q: Can you work in Vaughan's new developments?**
A: Absolutely. We coordinate with builders, respect warranty requirements, and understand the unique challenges of new subdivision drainage.

**Q: How long does installation take in Vaughan?**
A: Interior systems: 2-3 days. Exterior waterproofing: 5-7 days (weather dependent). Emergency stabilization: same day.
