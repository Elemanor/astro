With over 25 years of experience protecting Ontario homes, we understand the unique foundation challenges faced by Vaughan homeowners.

## Common Foundation Problems in Vaughan

### Clay Soil Challenges
Vaughan's clay-rich soil presents specific challenges:
- **Expansive Clay**: Swells when wet, shrinks when dry
- **Seasonal Movement**: Creates pressure on foundation walls
- **Settlement Issues**: Uneven soil compaction over time
- **Drainage Problems**: Clay retains water, increasing hydrostatic pressure

### Signs You Need Foundation Repair

**Interior Warning Signs:**
- Cracks in walls, especially at corners of doors and windows
- Uneven or sloping floors
- Doors and windows that stick or won't close properly
- Gaps between walls and ceiling or floor
- Basement wall cracks or bowing

**Exterior Warning Signs:**
- Cracks in brick or foundation walls
- Chimneys tilting or separating from house
- Gaps around window frames or doors
- Crumbling or flaking foundation
- Water pooling near foundation
