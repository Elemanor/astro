## Frequently Asked Questions - North York Basement Leaks

**Q: Why are basement leaks so common in North York?**
A: North York's heavy clay soil prevents natural drainage, creating hydrostatic pressure against foundations. Combined with the Don Valley watershed effects, this creates ideal conditions for basement leaks.

A: Properly executed repairs in North York conditions typically last 15-25+ years. Clay soil actually helps stabilize repair materials once properly installed.

**Q: Should I choose interior or exterior leak repair in North York?**
A: Interior repairs work well for North York's clay soil and are less disruptive. Exterior repairs provide maximum protection but require significant excavation through clay layers.

**Q: Do North York leak repairs work in clay soil?**
A: Yes, when properly designed for clay conditions. North York repairs require specialized techniques, but clay soil can actually enhance long-term repair performance.

**Q: How do Don Valley effects impact North York basement leaks?**
A: The Don Valley watershed influences groundwater flow throughout North York. Properties closer to ravines may experience seasonal water table fluctuations affecting leak patterns.
