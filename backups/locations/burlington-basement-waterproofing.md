## Burlington Waterproofing FAQ

**Q: How do you handle escarpment springs?**
A: We're experts at capturing and redirecting natural springs using French drains and relief wells. We work with the natural water flow rather than trying to stop it.

**Q: What about Burlington's older homes?**
A: We specialize in stone and rubble foundations common in older Burlington homes. Our techniques preserve the structure while providing modern protection.

**Q: Do you work near the lake?**
A: Yes, we understand lake-influenced water tables and use systems designed for high water conditions. Many Shoreacres and Roseland clients trust us.

**Q: Can you handle rock excavation?**
A: Absolutely. We have specialized equipment for Burlington's escarpment rock conditions and experienced operators who work carefully around foundations.

**Q: What about finished basements?**
A: We use minimally invasive techniques to protect finished spaces when possible, though some removal may be necessary for proper waterproofing.
