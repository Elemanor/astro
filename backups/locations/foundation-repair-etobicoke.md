**24/7 Emergency Foundation Repair: (437) 545-0067**

## Why Etobicoke Foundations Need Specialized Repair

### Humber River Valley Clay Soils
Etobicoke's location along the Humber River creates unique foundation challenges that require specialized repair techniques:

**Clay Soil Characteristics:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if my foundation needs repair?
Foundation problems rarely fix themselves and typically worsen over time. Warning signs include new or growing cracks, doors that stick, basement moisture, or any evidence of foundation movement. Our free assessment can determine if repair is needed and provide multiple solution options.

### Will foundation repair disrupt my daily life?
Most foundation repairs are completed from outside your home with minimal interior disruption. We protect landscaping, provide daily cleanup, and work around your schedule. Interior access is typically only needed for final inspections.

### How long do foundation repairs last?
Our foundation repairs are permanent solutions designed to last the lifetime of your home. We provide 25-year transferable warranties on structural work, and many of our repairs from the 1990s continue to perform perfectly today.

### Does insurance cover foundation repair?
Insurance coverage varies by policy and cause of damage. Sudden foundation damage from storms, plumbing failures, or other covered events may be covered. We provide detailed reports for insurance claims and can recommend coverage for foundation issues.

### Can I sell my home with foundation problems?
Yes, but foundation issues will affect your sale price and buyer confidence. Many buyers will either negotiate significant price reductions or walk away entirely. Investment in professional foundation repair typically recovers 80-100% of costs in increased sale price and faster sale.

### How do you ensure minimal damage to my landscaping?
We use compact equipment specifically designed for residential foundation work. Excavation is minimized through advanced repair techniques, and we provide complete landscape restoration as part of our service. Most customers are amazed at how little disruption occurs.

### What happens if you find additional problems during repair?
Our comprehensive assessment identifies most issues before work begins. If additional problems are discovered, we stop work, explain the situation, provide additional options, and only proceed with your approval. No surprise charges ever.

### Do you work in winter conditions?
Yes, most foundation repairs can be completed year-round. Some exterior excavation work may be delayed during extreme weather, but interior repairs and emergency services continue regardless of season.
