faq:
  - question: "How do I find reputable foundation repair contractors near me?"
    answer: "Look for contractors with local addresses, 10+ years experience, proper licensing, insurance, and neighborhood references. Check BBB ratings, online reviews, and ask neighbors for recommendations. Avoid door-to-door sales and cash-only contractors."
  - question: "How quickly can someone repair my foundation?"
    answer: "Emergency stabilization is available within 2-4 hours. Standard inspections are scheduled within 48 hours. Minor repairs like crack injection can be completed same-day. Major repairs require 1-4 weeks depending on scope and permits."
  - question: "What foundation problems require immediate repair?"
    answer: "Horizontal cracks, wall bowing, sudden settlement, active water intrusion, and any structural movement require immediate attention. Vertical hairline cracks and minor moisture can be scheduled normally. When in doubt, call for assessment."
  - question: "How much do local foundation repairs typically cost?"
    answer: "Costs vary by issue: crack repair ($500-1,500), waterproofing ($3,000-15,000), wall reinforcement ($5,000-10,000), underpinning ($20,000-40,000). Get multiple local quotes as prices vary by neighborhood and accessibility."
  - question: "Do foundation repair companies near me offer warranties?"
    answer: "Reputable local contractors offer warranties from 10 years to lifetime. Look for transferable warranties that add value when selling. Ensure warranties cover both materials and labor. Local companies provide better warranty service."
  - question: "Can foundation repairs be done in winter?"
    answer: "Yes, most foundation repairs can be done year-round. Interior waterproofing and crack injection work in any weather. Exterior work may face delays in extreme cold but emergency repairs proceed regardless of weather."
  - question: "How do I know if I need foundation repair?"
    answer: "Warning signs include cracks wider than 1/4\", doors/windows sticking, floor slopes, wall bowing, or water intrusion. Professional inspection can determine if repairs are needed. Many contractors offer free assessments."
  - question: "Will foundation repair disrupt my home?"
    answer: "Interior repairs cause minimal disruption - most families stay home during work. Exterior repairs are outside but may be noisy. Professional contractors minimize impact with daily cleanup and clear scheduling."
  - question: "Should I get multiple foundation repair quotes?"
    answer: "Yes, get 2-3 quotes from local contractors. Compare not just price but methods proposed, warranties offered, timeline, and company reputation. Beware of quotes significantly lower than others."
  - question: "What makes a foundation contractor 'local'?"
    answer: "Local contractors have physical offices in your area, employ local workers, understand regional soil/climate conditions, maintain local licenses, and can provide nearby references. They're accountable to your community."
