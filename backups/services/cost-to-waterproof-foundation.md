faq:
  - question: "How much does it cost to waterproof a foundation in Toronto?"
    answer: "Foundation waterproofing in Toronto costs $15,000-30,000 for exterior waterproofing and $5,000-12,000 for interior systems. Costs vary based on foundation size, depth, soil conditions, and chosen method. Most homes require $150-250 per linear foot for comprehensive exterior waterproofing."
  - question: "Is exterior waterproofing worth the extra cost?"
    answer: "Exterior waterproofing costs 2-3x more than interior systems but provides 99-100% effectiveness by stopping water at the source. It's worth the cost for severe water problems, when selling soon, or for maximum protection. Interior systems offer better value for moderate issues."
  - question: "What's included in foundation waterproofing costs?"
    answer: "Professional waterproofing includes excavation (for exterior), waterproof membrane application, drainage system installation, sump pumps (for interior), backfilling, grading, and warranty. Quality contractors include permits, cleanup, and restoration in their quotes."
  - question: "Can I waterproof my foundation in stages to reduce costs?"
    answer: "Yes, phased waterproofing is possible but less cost-effective long-term. You can start with the worst walls or interior systems first. However, mobilization costs mean doing it all at once saves 20-30% versus phased approach."
  - question: "How do soil conditions affect waterproofing costs?"
    answer: "Clay soil adds 20-30% due to expansion issues and difficult excavation. Rocky soil increases costs 30-50% from specialized equipment needs. Sandy soil is ideal. High water tables require continuous pumping, adding $2,000-5,000."
  - question: "Why do foundation waterproofing quotes vary so much?"
    answer: "Quotes vary based on methods proposed (interior vs. exterior), warranty length (5 years to lifetime), company overhead, material quality, and included services. Ensure you're comparing similar scopes of work, not just bottom-line prices."
  - question: "Does foundation waterproofing increase home value?"
    answer: "Yes, professional foundation waterproofing typically adds 5-10% to home value immediately. More importantly, it prevents value loss from water damage, makes homes sell faster, and provides transferable warranty value to buyers."
  - question: "What financing options exist for foundation waterproofing?"
    answer: "Options include contractor financing (often 0% for 12-24 months), home equity loans (lowest rates), personal loans, and payment plans. Government subsidies up to $3,400 may apply. Most contractors offer same-day financing approval."
  - question: "How long does foundation waterproofing last?"
    answer: "Quality exterior waterproofing lasts 25-30+ years with proper materials. Interior systems last 20-25 years with maintenance. Rubber membranes have 30+ year life expectancy. Warranties typically cover 10 years to lifetime."
  - question: "Can I just waterproof problem areas to save money?"
    answer: "Partial waterproofing saves money initially but often fails because water finds new paths. It's like fixing half a roof. Comprehensive solutions cost more upfront but provide lasting protection and better long-term value."
