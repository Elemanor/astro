## Common Waterproofing Questions

**Q: Which system is more effective?**
A: Both systems are highly effective when properly installed. Exterior waterproofing stops water before entry, while interior systems efficiently manage any water that does penetrate. Your specific situation determines the best choice.

**Q: Can I waterproof in winter?**
A: Interior waterproofing installs year-round. Exterior work requires temperatures above freezing for proper membrane application and curing.

**Q: How long does waterproofing last?**
A: Quality interior systems last 30+ years with minimal maintenance. Exterior waterproofing, when properly installed, provides lifetime protection.

**Q: Will waterproofing increase my home value?**
A: Yes. Waterproofing typically returns 10-15% in increased home value, plus faster sales and fewer buyer objections.

**Q: Do I need permits?**
A: Interior waterproofing rarely requires permits. Exterior excavation typically needs permits and utility locates.
