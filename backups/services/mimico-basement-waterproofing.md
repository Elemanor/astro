    content: |
      Mimico's unique position along Lake Ontario creates some of the most challenging waterproofing conditions in the GTA. This historic lakefront community faces constant moisture challenges from lake effects, high water tables, and sandy soil conditions that require specialized expertise.

      Mimico's specific waterproofing challenges:
      - Extremely high water table due to Lake Ontario proximity
      - Sandy soil that allows rapid water movement
      - Lake effect weather creating prolonged moisture exposure
      - Historic homes with foundations below water table
      - Storm surge effects during severe weather events
      - Salt air corrosion affecting foundation materials

      We've protected over 350 Mimico homes, from historic cottages near the waterfront to modern condos on Royal York Road. Our solutions are specifically engineered for lakefront conditions and high water table management.
  - title: "Lakefront Water Problems"
    content: |
      **High Water Table Issues**
      Mimico's proximity to Lake Ontario creates:
      - Basement floors constantly under hydrostatic pressure
      - Water seepage through foundation walls and floor joints
      - Sump pumps running continuously during spring thaw
      - Efflorescence from groundwater mineral content
      - Foundation settlement from saturated sandy soil

      **Lake Effect Weather**
      Constant moisture exposure causes:
      - Extended periods of high humidity
      - Repeated freeze-thaw cycles damaging foundations
      - Wind-driven rain penetrating exterior walls
      - Snow accumulation creating spring flooding
      - Salt air accelerating material deterioration

      **Sandy Soil Complications**
      Unlike clay areas, Mimico's sandy soil:
      - Allows rapid water movement toward foundations
      - Provides poor support for foundation systems
      - Enables quick drainage but also rapid infiltration
      - Shifts and settles under water pressure
      - Requires specialized excavation techniques

      **Historic Foundation Challenges**
      Many Mimico homes built near the lake feature:
      - Stone foundations from early 1900s
      - Basements excavated below water table
      - Original construction not designed for current water levels
      - No vapor barriers or modern waterproofing
      - Foundations compromised by decades of water exposure

      **Storm Surge Effects**
      Severe weather events create:
      - Temporary water table elevation
      - Overwhelmed municipal storm systems
      - Backflow from storm sewers
      - Flooding from multiple directions
      - Emergency water removal needs
  - title: "Lakefront Specialized Solutions"
    content: |
      **High-Capacity Interior Systems**
      Essential for high water table conditions:
      - Multiple sump pump installations with battery backup
      - High-volume drainage systems handling constant flow
      - Vapor barriers preventing humidity transmission
      - Dehumidification integration for lake effect moisture
      - Emergency water removal capabilities

      **Advanced Exterior Waterproofing**
      When complete exterior protection is needed:
      - Marine-grade membranes designed for constant water contact
      - Enhanced drainage systems for sandy soil conditions
      - Specialized backfill preventing water accumulation
      - Integration with municipal storm systems
      - Protection against salt air corrosion

      **Foundation Stabilization**
      Sandy soil and water often require:
      - Underpinning for foundations affected by water
      - Crack injection systems for hydrostatic pressure
      - Soil stabilization around foundation perimeter
      - Structural reinforcement for settlement issues
      - Integration with existing foundation systems

      **Emergency Water Management**
      Critical for lakefront properties:
      - 24/7 emergency water removal services

faq:
  - question: "Why do Mimico basements have more water problems than other areas?"
    answer: "Mimico's location on Lake Ontario creates a permanently high water table, often just 2-3 feet below ground. Combined with sandy soil that transmits water quickly and lake effect weather that creates extended wet periods, basements face constant hydrostatic pressure and moisture challenges."
  - question: "Can you waterproof a basement below the water table?"
    answer: "Yes, this is common in Mimico. We use specialized interior systems designed for constant water pressure, including high-capacity drainage and multiple sump pumps. The key is managing water flow rather than trying to block it completely - we channel water safely away from living spaces."
  - question: "How do lake effects impact waterproofing?"
    answer: "Lake Ontario creates unique challenges including extended humid periods, salt air corrosion, storm surges that temporarily raise water levels, and freeze-thaw cycles. Our systems are designed with marine-grade materials and enhanced drainage to handle these harsh lakefront conditions."
  - question: "What's different about working in sandy soil?"
    answer: "Sandy soil allows rapid water movement but also quick drainage. Excavation requires different techniques than clay areas, and we use specialized backfill materials. Sandy soil also provides less foundation support, so we often combine waterproofing with stabilization work."
  - question: "How do you handle emergency flooding in Mimico?"
    answer: "We maintain 24/7 emergency response specifically for lakefront properties with response times under 2 hours. Our crews are equipped for rapid water removal, temporary protection measures, and coordination with emergency services during storm events."
  - question: "Can sump pumps handle Mimico's water table?"
    answer: "Standard pumps often can't. We install high-capacity systems with backup pumps and battery power for extended outages. Many Mimico homes need multiple pumps due to constant water flow. We size systems specifically for each property's water table conditions."
  - question: "Do you work with condo buildings near the lake?"
    answer: "Yes, we regularly work with waterfront condominiums and understand their unique challenges including shared drainage systems, building management coordination, and minimal resident disruption. We're experienced with condo board requirements and insurance needs."
  - question: "How long does waterproofing take in sandy soil?"
    answer: "Sandy soil actually allows faster excavation than clay, but requires more careful backfill and drainage installation. Interior systems take 3-4 days, exterior projects 4-6 days depending on water table conditions. Weather and water levels affect timing."
  - question: "What warranty coverage applies to high water table conditions?"
    answer: "Our lifetime transferable warranty fully covers high water table applications. We're confident in our Mimico-specific systems because they're designed for these challenging conditions. The warranty includes provisions for lakefront environmental factors."
  - question: "Can you work during winter near the lake?"
    answer: "Yes, though lake effect weather requires flexible scheduling. We monitor conditions closely and adjust work plans for safety and quality. Emergency services continue year-round, and we maintain heated equipment for winter operations when needed."
  - question: "How do you protect against salt air corrosion?"
    answer: "We use marine-grade materials designed for coastal environments, including corrosion-resistant metals and enhanced protective coatings. All materials are selected specifically for salt air exposure, and we provide additional protection for vulnerable components."
  - question: "Do you offer financing for lakefront waterproofing?"
    answer: "Yes, including programs specifically for coastal property owners who may need more extensive systems. We understand lakefront waterproofing often requires larger investments and work to make proper protection affordable for Mimico homeowners."
