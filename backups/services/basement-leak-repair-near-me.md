    answer: "Local companies offer faster response times, lower costs (no travel charges), better knowledge of local soil/building conditions, established community reputation, and ongoing local support. They understand local building codes, have relationships with area inspectors, and their reputation depends on neighborhood satisfaction. National companies may have standard solutions that don't address local conditions."
  - question: "Do local basement repair companies cost more than large chains?"
    answer: "Local companies often cost less due to lower overhead, no franchise fees, and elimination of travel charges. They offer competitive pricing with personalized service, local supplier relationships, and knowledge of cost-effective solutions for your area's specific conditions. Many provide multi-neighbor discounts and have established relationships for faster, less expensive permit processing."
  - question: "How do I verify a local basement repair company's credentials?"
    answer: "Check their physical local address, verify licenses with your city/province, confirm insurance coverage, check Better Business Bureau ratings, read local online reviews, ask for recent neighborhood references, and verify warranty terms.

Local companies understand regional insurance practices and adjuster requirements."
  - question: "What basement problems require immediate local repair?"

Minor repairs like crack injection take 1 day, interior waterproofing takes 2-3 days, and exterior waterproofing takes 3-7 days depending on scope and weather. Local companies can often work faster due to nearby material suppliers and familiarity with local permit processes."
  - question: "Do local basement repair companies offer warranties?"
    answer: "Reputable local companies typically offer comprehensive warranties from 10 years to lifetime on their work.
