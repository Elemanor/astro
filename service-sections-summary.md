## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Add Pricing Information** (High Impact)
Currently only 6 pages show pricing. Adding pricing would:
- Display the blue pricing CTA section
- Improve conversion rates
- Provide transparency

Example fields to add:
```yaml
starting_price: "$2,499"
price_range: "$2,499 - $12,999"
```

### 2. **Add Benefits Section** (Medium Impact)
No pages currently show benefits. Adding would:
- Display "Why Choose Our Service" section
- Highlight unique value propositions

Example structure:
```yaml
benefits:
  - title: "25 Year Warranty"
    description: "Industry-leading protection for your investment"
  - title: "Same Day Service"
    description: "Emergency response when you need it most"
  - title: "Licensed Experts"
    description: "Fully certified and insured professionals"
```

### 3. **Customize Process Steps** (Low Impact)
All pages use generic 4-step process. Service-specific steps would:
- Provide more relevant information
- Improve user understanding

Example:
```yaml
process_steps:
  - title: "Water Assessment"
    description: "Identify source and extent of water issues"
    icon: "search"
  - title: "Custom Solution Design"
    description: "Tailored approach for your specific problem"
    icon: "lightbulb"
```

### 4. **Add Hero Features** (Low Impact)
Quick bullet points in hero section:
```yaml
hero:
  features:
    - "Free Estimates"
    - "Emergency 24/7"
    - "Lifetime Warranty"
```

## Coverage by Service Type

Most complete pages (with 3+ optional sections):
- Location pages: Good coverage (related services + FAQ)
- Main services: Good coverage
- Specialty services: Lower coverage

Pages needing most improvement:
- Cost/pricing pages (ironically missing pricing)
- DIY guides (missing benefits)
- Emergency services (missing urgency indicators)
