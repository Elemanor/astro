    question: "How do I know what my basement needs?",
    answer: "Start with a professional assessment. We inspect thoroughly, explain findings clearly, and recommend only necessary work. Many problems have multiple solutions - we'll explain all options. Our free inspection includes checking for water damage, foundation cracks, structural issues, and drainage problems."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle complex situations?",
    answer: "Complex is our specialty. Semi-detached homes needing party wall agreements. Century homes with rubble foundations. Finished basements with hidden problems. We've successfully handled virtually every type of challenge Toronto basements can present. Our team includes structural engineers for the most complicated projects."
  },
  {
    question: "What about permits and regulations?",
    answer: "We handle all permits and ensure code compliance. This protects your investment and prevents future issues. Our established relationships with city inspectors help streamline approvals. Permit costs and timelines are outlined in your estimate. We're fully licensed and insured for all basement work in Toronto and the GTA."
  },
  {
    question: "What about payment terms?",
    answer: "We offer flexible payment schedules for larger projects. Typically: deposit upon signing, progress payments during work, final payment upon completion. All terms clearly outlined in contract. We accept various payment methods and offer financing options with 0% interest for qualified customers."
  },
  {
    question: "How disruptive is basement work?",
    answer: "We minimize disruption through efficient scheduling and clean work practices. Most clients stay home during waterproofing. Underpinning is more involved but completes quickly. We'll discuss your specific situation during consultation and work around your family's schedule whenever possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee your work?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Written warranties on all work, with terms varying by service type. Waterproofing warranties typically range from 5-10 years. Underpinning includes structural guarantees. We're local and established - we'll be here if needed. Warranty details provided with every quote. Many warranties are transferable to new homeowners."
