  - title: Agincourt's Waterproofing Challenges
    content: >
      Agincourt faces unique waterproofing challenges due to its location in
      northeast Scarborough. The area's clay-heavy soil, combined with aging
      infrastructure and increasing rainfall, creates perfect conditions for
      basement water problems.


      Our local Agincourt team understands these specific challenges:

      - Heavy clay soil that expands and contracts

      - Older homes built in the 1960s-1980s with aging foundations

      - Storm sewer systems struggling with modern rainfall

      - High water table near Highland Creek watershed

      - Mix of bungalows and two-story homes with different foundation depths


      We've waterproofed hundreds of Agincourt homes, from the heritage
      properties near Milliken to newer developments along Sheppard. Our
      solutions are designed specifically for Agincourt's conditions.
  - title: Common Agincourt Water Problems
    content: >
      **Clay Soil Movement**

      Agincourt's clay soil creates unique challenges. During dry periods, it
      shrinks away from foundations, creating gaps. When rain comes, it expands
      dramatically, putting enormous pressure on foundation walls. This cycle
      causes:

      - Foundation cracks

      - Basement wall bowing

      - Window well flooding

      - Floor heaving


      **Aging Foundation Issues**

      Many Agincourt homes built in the 1970s now show:

      - Deteriorating parging

      - Failed exterior waterproofing

      - Crumbling mortar joints

      - Insufficient drainage systems


      **Storm Water Overload**

      Recent development has increased runoff, overwhelming:

      - Original storm sewers

      - Home drainage systems

      - Weeping tile from the era

      - Sump pump capacity

      - New drainage tile installation
      - Proper grading restoration
      - Window well reconstruction

      **Sump Pump Upgrades**

      - High-capacity pumps for storm surges
      - Battery backup systems
      - Alarm monitoring
      - Annual maintenance programs

faq:
  - question: Why do so many Agincourt homes have water problems?
    answer: >-
      Agincourt's clay soil, aging infrastructure, and increased development
      create perfect conditions for water issues. Homes built in the 1960s-1980s
      often have deteriorating waterproofing, while the area's storm systems
      struggle with modern rainfall levels.
  - question: What's the best waterproofing solution for Agincourt homes?
    answer: >-
      It depends on your specific situation. Interior systems work well for
      finished basements and managing seasonal water. Exterior waterproofing
      provides comprehensive protection for severe issues. Many Agincourt homes
      benefit from combined approaches due to clay soil challenges.
  - question: How long does waterproofing take in Agincourt?
    answer: >-
      Interior waterproofing typically takes 2-3 days. Exterior projects require
      5-7 days depending on home size and soil conditions. Agincourt's clay soil
      may require additional excavation time. We provide detailed timelines
      during inspection.

      inspector preferences.
  - question: What about my finished basement?
    answer: >-
      We specialize in protecting finished basements. Interior waterproofing can
      often be installed with minimal disruption to finishing. For exterior
      work, we carefully remove and can reinstall sections as needed. Many
      Agincourt clients waterproof without major renovation.
  - question: How do you handle Agincourt's clay soil?
    answer: >-
      We use specialized techniques for clay soil including proper drainage
      stone selection, enhanced membrane systems, and flexible sealants that
      accommodate movement. Our systems are designed specifically for clay soil
      expansion and contraction cycles.
  - question: What warranty coverage do you provide?

      transfers to new owners. Essential for Agincourt's real estate market.
  - question: Can you work around mature trees?

      Yes, many Agincourt properties have beautiful mature trees. We use
      specialized excavation techniques, hand digging when necessary, and root
      protection systems. We've successfully waterproofed hundreds of homes
      while preserving landscaping.
