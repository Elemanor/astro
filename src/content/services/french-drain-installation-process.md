### French Drain vs Weeping Tile: Understanding the Critical Difference

**Important Clarification for Toronto Homeowners:**

Many contractors incorrectly use "French drain" and "weeping tile" interchangeably, leading to inappropriate solutions and failed installations. Understanding the difference is critical for getting the right system:

**French Drains (This Page):**
- **Depth**: 2-4 feet for surface and subsurface drainage
- **Purpose**: Yard drainage, surface water management, landscape drainage
- **Applications**: Standing water in yards, driveway drainage, surface runoff
- **Cost**: $1,800-$8,500 depending on complexity
- **Timeline**: 6-16 hours installation time

**Weeping Tile (Foundation Drainage):**
- **Depth**: 6-8 feet down to foundation footings
- **Purpose**: Foundation protection, basement waterproofing, groundwater management
- **Applications**: Basement water problems, foundation protection, new construction
- **Cost**: $12,000-$35,000 for complete foundation systems
- **Timeline**: 5-10 days installation time
