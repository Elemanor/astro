    content: >
      Exterior waterproofing Toronto is the most effective way to protect your
      foundation. As leading basement contractors Toronto, we excavate around
      your home and apply waterproof membranes directly to the outside walls,
      creating an impenetrable barrier that stops water before it can enter.


      This comprehensive exterior basement waterproofing approach not only keeps
      your Toronto basement dry but also protects your foundation from water
      damage, freeze-thaw cycles, and deterioration. Unlike interior
      waterproofing alone, exterior waterproofing Toronto adds decades to your
      home's life.
  - title: Our Complete Exterior Process
    content: >
      **Full Excavation** - We carefully excavate down to the footing, exposing
      the entire foundation wall for proper treatment.


      **Wall Preparation** - Cracks are repaired, walls are cleaned and parged
      smooth, creating the ideal surface for waterproofing.


      **Membrane Application** - Premium rubberized or dimpled membrane creates
      a seamless waterproof barrier from grade to footing.


      **Drainage System** - New weeping tile and gravel ensure water is directed
      away from your foundation permanently.

      - Protects foundation integrity

      For homes with serious water issues or valuable finished basements,
      exterior waterproofing is always worth it.
  - question: How much does exterior waterproofing cost in Toronto?
    answer: >
      Exterior waterproofing Toronto costs typically range from $300-500 per

      waterproofing Toronto cost for exterior systems varies based on excavation
      Toronto requirements, access, soil type, and additional repairs. Exterior
      waterproofing costs more than interior waterproofing Toronto but provides
