      Effective drainage is the foundation of dry basements and stable
      foundations. Toronto's clay soil, high water tables, and extreme weather
      create unique drainage challenges that require professional solutions.
      From French drains to comprehensive water management systems, proper
      drainage protects your investment.


      This guide explores proven drainage solutions, helping you understand
      options, compare systems, and make informed decisions about protecting
      your property from water damage.

      **Managing Water Through Engineering**


      Water follows the path of least resistance. Professional drainage systems
      create controlled pathways that direct water away from your foundation,
      preventing hydrostatic pressure, soil saturation, and structural damage.
      Modern drainage combines time-tested principles with advanced materials
      for superior performance.


      Whether addressing surface water, groundwater, or both, the right drainage
      system transforms water from a destructive force into a manageable
      resource that flows harmlessly away from your home.

A: Properly installed systems below frost line don't freeze. Discharge lines need appropriate depth and slope.

**Q: How often should drains be cleaned?**
A: Most systems need cleaning every 5-10 years. Heavy root areas or fine soil may require more frequent service.

**Q: Will drainage solve all water problems?**
A: Drainage manages water effectively but may need combination with waterproofing for complete protection.

**Q: Can I install drainage myself?**
A: While possible, professional installation ensures proper design, permits, and long-term performance.
