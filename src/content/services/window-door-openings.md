    content: >
      Your basement needs light, air, and emergency exits. Whether creating
      legal bedrooms, adding rental suite entrances, or simply brightening dark
      spaces, cutting foundation openings transforms basements. But this isn't
      demolition - it's precision structural work requiring expertise.


      Cutting concrete foundations wrong leads to cracks, settlement, and
      structural failure. We've seen DIY disasters and poor contractor work that
      compromised entire homes. Done properly, new openings enhance your home
      while maintaining - even improving - structural integrity.


      Our window and door opening services include:

      - Egress window creation for legal bedrooms

      - Standard window installation and enlargement

      - Door openings for separate entrances

      - Structural assessment and engineering

      - Proper headers and load transfer

      - Complete finishing and waterproofing

      - Permit handling and inspections

      - Window well construction if needed


      Every opening is engineered specifically for your foundation type, load
      requirements, and intended use.
  - title: Egress Windows - Safety and Code Compliance
    content: >
      **Legal Bedrooms Require Legal Exits**


      Building codes mandate emergency exits from basement bedrooms. Egress
      windows provide:

      - Minimum opening of 3.8 sq ft

      - No dimension less than 380mm (15")

      - Sill height maximum 1000mm (39") above floor

      - Clear, unobstructed opening

      - Permanent ladder or steps if needed


      Without proper egress, basement bedrooms are:

      - Illegal for occupancy

      - Dangerous in emergencies

      - Invalid for home appraisals

      - Uninsurable as bedrooms

      - Rental income risks


      **The Egress Installation Process:**

      1. Structural assessment of proposed location

      2. Engineering for load transfer requirements

      3. Precision cutting maintaining supports

      4. Steel lintel installation above opening

      5. Window well excavation and construction

      6. Proper drainage and waterproofing

      7. Window installation to code

      8. Interior and exterior finishing


      We ensure full code compliance for legal, safe bedrooms.
  - title: Door Openings for Separate Entrances
    content: >
      **Creating Independent Access**


      Adding doors to foundations enables:

      - Legal basement apartments

      - Private family suites

      - Home office entrances

      - Direct garage access

      - Garden level walkouts


      Door openings require more structural consideration than windows:

      - Larger spans need bigger headers

      - Load paths must be maintained

      - Waterproofing is critical

      - Proper landings required

      - Step construction often needed


      **Our Door Opening Process:**

      1. Determine optimal location

      2. Verify no critical utilities in path

      3. Install temporary supports

      4. Cut opening in controlled sections

      5. Install engineered steel header

      6. Pour concrete sill

      7. Waterproof entire opening

      8. Frame for door installation


      Whether creating a full walkout entrance or simple access door, structural
      integrity comes first.
  - title: Window Enlargement and Addition
    content: >
      **More Light, Better Basements**


      Dark basements feel like dungeons. Adding or enlarging windows transforms
      them into bright, welcoming spaces. Benefits include:

      - Natural light throughout day

      - Ventilation for air quality

      - Views to outside

      - Reduced lighting costs

      - Higher property values

      - Improved mental health


      **Common Window Projects:**

      - Enlarging existing small windows

      - Adding windows to blank walls

      - Converting windows to egress size

      - Creating window walls

      - Installing glass block

      - Adding transom windows


      **Size Considerations:**

      Small basement windows often date from when basements stored coal, not
      people. Modern living requires modern window sizes. We commonly:

      - Double or triple existing openings

      - Add multiple windows for even light

      - Create picture windows for views

      - Install sliding windows for ventilation
  - title: Structural Considerations
    content: |
      **It's Not Just Cutting Concrete**

      Foundation walls carry tremendous loads. Improper cutting causes:
      - Cracks radiating from openings
      - Settlement above windows
      - Water infiltration points
      - Compromised wall strength
      - Door/window operation problems

      **Our Structural Approach:**

      **Load Analysis**
      We calculate loads above each opening:
      - Dead loads from structure
      - Live loads from occupancy
      - Snow loads on roof
      - Lateral earth pressure
      - Point loads from beams

      **Header Design**
      Every opening needs proper support:
      - Steel lintels sized for loads
      - Adequate bearing on each side
      - Proper attachment to wall
      - Corrosion protection
      - Thermal break considerations

      **Reinforcement Requirements**
      Foundation openings often need:
      - Additional rebar around openings
      - Crack control measures
      - Corner reinforcement
      - Proper development lengths
      - Connection to existing steel

      **Crack Prevention**
      Strategic cutting prevents problems:
      - Score lines guide any cracking
      - Staged cutting maintains support
      - Proper curing of repairs
      - Control joints where needed

      This engineering ensures lasting, problem-free openings.
  - title: The Cutting Process

      Most openings complete within one week, weather permitting.
  - title: Waterproofing New Openings
    content: >
      **Every Opening Needs Protection**


      Cut openings become water entry points without proper waterproofing:


      **Window Wells**

      Excavated window wells require:

      - Proper drainage to weeping tile

      - Gravel base for water management

      - Well walls (galvanized, concrete, or plastic)

      - Covers to shed rain

      - Integration with foundation drainage


      **Membrane Systems**

      All openings get comprehensive waterproofing:

      - Self-adhering membranes

      - Proper flashing details

      - Sill pan protection

      - Corner reinforcement

      - Connection to existing systems


      **Drainage Integration**

      Water needs somewhere to go:

      - Window well drains

      - Connection to sump pump systems

      - Positive grading away

      - Proper discharge points


      Poor waterproofing turns improvements into water problems. We ensure
      lasting dry openings.

      - Integrated water management

      - Single excavation

      - Comprehensive protection

      - Cost savings


      **Before Renovations**

      Add windows and doors before finishing:

      - Easier construction access

      - Proper sizing for layouts

      - No refinishing required

      - Dust/debris not an issue


      **Creating Suites**

      Combine with walkout construction for complete apartment creation:

      - Separate entrance

faq:
  - question: Do I need a permit to cut windows or doors in my foundation?
    answer: >-
      Yes, all foundation openings require building permits in Toronto. This
      includes structural drawings and often engineer stamps. We handle the
      complete permit process for you.
  - question: How long does it take to cut a window opening?
    answer: >-
      Most window openings complete within 3-5 days. This includes cutting,
      structural installation, waterproofing, and basic finishing. Door openings
      may take 5-7 days due to larger size.
  - question: Will cutting openings crack my foundation?
    answer: >-
      When done properly with correct engineering and techniques, new openings
      won't cause cracks. We use controlled cutting methods and proper
      reinforcement to maintain structural integrity.
  - question: What's the minimum size for an egress window?
    answer: >-
      Egress windows must have minimum 3.8 sq ft opening area, with no dimension
      less than 15 inches. The sill must be maximum 39 inches above the floor.
      We ensure full code compliance.
  - question: Can you cut openings in winter?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we can cut openings year-round. Winter work requires heated
      enclosures for concrete work and proper curing. Some exterior finishing
      may need to wait for warmer weather.
  - question: How much does an egress window cost?
    answer: >-
      Basic egress window cutting starts around $2,000-3,000. With window well,
      expect $3,500-5,000. Including the window itself, total costs typically
      range $4,000-6,000 depending on complexity.
  - question: Do new openings need waterproofing?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely. Every opening requires comprehensive waterproofing including
      membranes, proper drainage, and integration with existing systems. Poor
      waterproofing turns openings into leak points.
  - question: Can you add a door to create a basement apartment?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we regularly create separate entrances for legal basement apartments.
      This includes proper-sized openings, code-compliant stairs, adequate
      landings, and required permits.
  - question: What if there are utilities where I want the opening?
    answer: >-
      We always verify utility locations before cutting. If utilities are
      present, they can usually be relocated. We coordinate with appropriate
      trades to ensure safe relocation.
  - question: Will window wells fill with water?
    answer: >-
      Properly constructed window wells include drainage to weeping tile or
      storm systems. We ensure positive drainage and can add covers for extra
      protection. Wells shouldn't hold water.
