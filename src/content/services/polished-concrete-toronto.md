faq:
  - question: How much does polished concrete cost in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Polished concrete Toronto costs typically range from $3-8 per square foot,
      depending on the level of polish and preparation needed. Basic grinding
      and sealing starts at $3/sq ft, while high-gloss polished concrete with
      decorative options can reach $8/sq ft. This is often more affordable than
      traditional flooring when considering longevity.
  - question: Is polished concrete good for Toronto basements?
    answer: >-
      Yes, polished concrete is excellent for Toronto basements. It's
      moisture-resistant, won't harbor mold, and handles our temperature
      fluctuations well. When combined with proper basement waterproofing,
      polished concrete Toronto floors provide a durable, low-maintenance
      solution that brightens basement spaces.
  - question: How long does polished concrete last?
    answer: >-
      Properly installed polished concrete Toronto floors can last 20+ years
      with minimal maintenance. Unlike carpet or laminate that needs replacement
      every 5-10 years, polished concrete only requires occasional resealing.
      This makes it one of the most cost-effective flooring options for Toronto
      homes and businesses.
  - question: Can existing concrete be polished?
    answer: >-
      Most existing concrete floors can be polished, but condition matters. We
      assess for cracks, levelness, and moisture issues. Minor repairs are
      normal, but severely damaged concrete may need an overlay first. Our
      polished concrete Toronto experts provide free assessments to determine
      feasibility.
