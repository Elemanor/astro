faq:
  - question: What causes foundation cracks?
    answer: >-
      Foundation cracks result from settling, soil pressure, freeze-thaw cycles,
      water damage, or poor construction. Early repair prevents water
      infiltration and structural issues.
  - question: Are foundation cracks serious?
    answer: >-
      It depends on the type. Vertical hairline cracks are often cosmetic, while
      horizontal or widening cracks indicate structural issues requiring
      immediate attention.
  - question: What foundation repair method is best?
    answer: >-
      The best method depends on crack type and cause. We use epoxy injection
      for structural cracks, polyurethane for active leaks, and carbon fiber for
      reinforcement.
  - question: Is foundation repair permanent?
    answer: >-
      When properly diagnosed and repaired, foundation fixes are permanent. We
      address the underlying cause, not just symptoms, and back our work with
      comprehensive warranties.
