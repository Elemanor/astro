  - question: How do I know if I need emergency foundation waterproofing?
    answer: >-
      Call immediately for: active water entry, foundation cracks leaking,
      basement flooding, sump pump failure, or storm damage. DrySpace provides
      2-hour emergency response across Toronto with immediate damage assessment
      and temporary protection while permanent solutions are arranged.
  - question: Will foundation waterproofing increase my Toronto home value?
    answer: >-
      Yes, professional waterproofing typically increases Toronto home values by
      7-12% ($35,000-$70,000 on average home). Additional benefits include lower
      insurance premiums, energy savings, usable basement space, and faster home
      sales with documented protection.
  - question: What maintenance does foundation waterproofing require?
    answer: >-
      Annual professional inspections, seasonal sump pump testing, and
      monitoring for changes. DrySpace includes first 5 years of annual
      inspections and provides ongoing maintenance services. Simple homeowner
      tasks include humidity monitoring and maintaining proper drainage.
  - question: How do I verify a local foundation waterproofing contractor's reputation?
    answer: >-
      Check: physical local address, current licensing/insurance, BBB rating,
      recent neighborhood references, and years in business. Avoid door-to-door
      sales, upfront payment demands, and prices significantly below market.
      DrySpace provides 5+ local references and welcomes verification of all
      credentials.
