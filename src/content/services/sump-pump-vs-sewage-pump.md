    content: >
      If you're confused about the difference between sump pumps and sewage
      pumps (also called waste water pumps or ejector pumps), you're not alone.
      Both sit in your basement. Both pump water. Both prevent flooding. But
      they handle completely different water types and serve different purposes.
      Installing the wrong one can be disastrous - or illegal.


      Here's the simple truth: sump pumps handle clean groundwater, sewage pumps
      handle toilet waste. One keeps your basement dry, the other makes basement
      bathrooms possible. Many Toronto homes need both, but for entirely
      different reasons.


      Let's clear up the confusion with plain explanations, so you know exactly
      what you need and why.
  - title: What is a Sump Pump?
    content: >
      ### Your Defense Against Ground Water


      A sump pump removes clean water that tries to enter your basement from the
      ground. This includes rainwater, melting snow, and rising groundwater. It
      sits in a pit (sump basin) at your basement's lowest point, activating
      when water levels rise.


      **What Sump Pumps Handle:**

      - Groundwater seepage

      - Foundation drainage water

      - Rain infiltration

      - Spring thaw runoff

      - High water table pressure

      - Perimeter drain collection


      **What Sump Pumps DON'T Handle:**

      - Toilet waste

      - Sink drainage

      - Shower water

      - Laundry discharge

      - Any greywater

      - Any blackwater


      **How Sump Pumps Work:**

      ```

      Ground Water → Foundation Drains → Sump Pit → 

      Pump Activates → Discharge Outside → Away from House

      ```


      **Key Components:**

      - Sump pit/basin (18-24" diameter)

      - Submersible or pedestal pump

      - Float switch or sensor

      - Check valve

      - Discharge pipe

      - Power source (with backup ideally)
  - title: What is a Sewage Pump?
    content: >
      ### Your Basement Bathroom Solution


      A sewage pump (waste water pump/ejector pump) handles actual sewage from
      basement toilets, sinks, and showers located below your main sewer line.
      Without it, basement bathroom waste has nowhere to go - gravity won't
      carry it uphill to your sewer.


      **What Sewage Pumps Handle:**

      - Toilet waste (blackwater)

      - Shower/tub drainage (greywater)

      - Sink drainage

      - Laundry water

      - Floor drain water

      - Any plumbed fixture drainage


      **What Sewage Pumps DON'T Handle:**

      - Groundwater (illegal to pump into sewer)

      - Sump pump water

      - Foundation drainage

      - Rainwater

      - Pool drainage

      - Natural water sources


      **How Sewage Pumps Work:**

      ```

      Toilet/Sink → Sealed Tank → Macerator/Grinder → 

      Pump Activates → Lifts to Main Sewer → City Sewer

      ```


      **Key Components:**

      - Sealed sewage basin (with vented lid)

      - Grinder/macerator pump

      - Float switches (multiple)

      - Check valve and gate valve

      - Vent to roof

      - Discharge to main sewer
  - title: The Critical Differences
    content: |
      ### Water Type - The Main Distinction

      **Sump Pump Water:**
      - Clean(ish) groundwater
      - No solids
      - No sewage
      - Can discharge outside
      - Environmentally safe
      - No health hazards

      **Sewage Pump Water:**
      - Human waste
      - Toilet paper
      - Solid materials
      - MUST go to sewer
      - Biohazard
      - Health risks

      ### Legal Requirements

      **Sump Pumps:**
      - Can discharge to lawn (with restrictions)
      - Can connect to storm sewer (where allowed)
      - CANNOT connect to sanitary sewer
      - City bylaws vary on discharge location

      **Sewage Pumps:**
      - MUST connect to sanitary sewer
      - CANNOT discharge outside
      - Requires plumbing permit
      - Must meet plumbing code
      - Requires proper venting

      ### System Complexity

      **Sump Pump Systems:**
      - Open pit design for water collection
      - Simple cover (allows inspection)
      - Single discharge line
      - No venting requirements
      - Installed at basement's lowest point
      - Focuses on water removal only

      **Sewage Pump Systems:**
      - Completely sealed tank (health requirement)
      - Gasketed, airtight lid
      - Must vent gases to roof
      - Multiple plumbing connections
      - Located near bathroom fixtures
      - Handles solids and liquids

  - title: The Bottom Line
    content: >
      ### Sump Pumps:

      - Handle groundwater only

      - Discharge outside or storm sewer

      - Prevent basement flooding

      - Open pit acceptable

      - Simpler system design


      ### Sewage Pumps:

      - Handle bathroom waste

      - Discharge to sanitary sewer only

      - Enable basement bathrooms

      - Sealed system mandatory

      - Complex system requirements


      ### Remember:

      - **Never** use a sump pump for sewage

      - **Never** pump sewage outside

      - **Never** connect sump to sanitary sewer

      - **Always** get proper permits

      - **Always** hire professionals for sewage pumps


      ### The Confusion Costs:

      Using the wrong pump can result in:

      - Immediate pump failure

      - Sewage backup in basement

      - Environmental violations

      - Municipal fines

      - Health hazards

      - Insurance claims denied

      assessment. We install both types properly and can design complete
      basement water management systems.**
faq:
  - question: What's the main difference between a sump pump and sewage pump?
    answer: >-
      Sump pumps handle clean groundwater and discharge it outside or to storm
      sewers. Sewage pumps handle toilet waste and greywater, grinding solids
      and pumping them to your sanitary sewer. Using the wrong pump is illegal
      and dangerous.
  - question: Can I use a sump pump for my basement bathroom?
    answer: >-
      No! Sump pumps cannot handle sewage or solids. They'll clog immediately
      with toilet waste. You need a sewage pump (ejector pump) with grinding
      capability designed specifically for bathroom waste.
  - question: Where does each pump discharge water?
    answer: >-
      Sump pumps discharge outside your home (10+ feet from foundation) or to
      storm sewers where allowed. Sewage pumps MUST discharge to your sanitary
      sewer line - it's illegal to pump sewage outside or into storm sewers.
  - question: Do I need both pumps in my basement?
    answer: >-
      Many finished basements need both: a sump pump to manage groundwater and
      prevent flooding, and a sewage pump if you have a bathroom below your main
      sewer line. They serve completely different purposes.
  - question: Which pump costs more to install?
    answer: >-
      Sewage pumps typically cost more: $2,500-8,000 installed vs $1,200-4,000
      for sump pumps. Sewage pumps require sealed tanks, venting to roof,
      complex plumbing connections, and professional installation.
  - question: Why is professional installation important?
    answer: >-
      Professional installation ensures proper sizing, code compliance, and
      reliable operation. Sewage pumps especially require professional
      installation due to health hazards, venting requirements, and plumbing
      codes. Even sump pumps benefit from professional installation to ensure
      optimal performance and warranty coverage.
  - question: How long do these pumps last?
    answer: >-
      Sump pumps typically last 7-10 years with regular use and maintenance.
      Sewage pumps last 7-15 years depending on usage. Both require annual
      professional maintenance for optimal lifespan.
  - question: What happens if I connect my sump pump to the sewer?
    answer: >-
      This is illegal in most municipalities including Toronto. You face heavy
      fines, contribute to sewer overflow during storms, and may have insurance
      claims denied. Sump water must go to appropriate storm drainage.
  - question: Do sewage pumps smell?
    answer: >-
      Properly installed sewage pumps with sealed tanks and correct venting
      shouldn't smell. Odors indicate problems: poor seals, blocked vents, or
      maintenance needs. The system should be completely sealed and vented to
      your roof.
  - question: What size pump do I need?
    answer: >-
      For sump pumps: 1/3 HP handles most residential needs, 1/2 HP for high
      water volume. For sewage pumps: 1/2 HP minimum for half bath, 3/4 HP for
      full bath, 1 HP for multiple fixtures or apartments.
