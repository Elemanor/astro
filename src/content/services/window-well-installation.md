# Window Well Installation & Repair Services

**Protect your basement windows with professional window well solutions from Toronto's trusted experts**

Properly installed window wells are crucial for basement protection, providing emergency egress while preventing water infiltration. At DrySpace, we specialize in custom window well solutions that combine safety, functionality, and effective water management for Toronto homes.

## Understanding Window Wells

### What Are Window Wells?

Window wells are excavated areas around basement windows that:
- Allow natural light into basements
- Provide emergency exit routes
- Prevent soil pressure on windows
- Manage water away from openings
- Enable proper window operation

### Why Window Wells Fail

Common problems we encounter:

- **Poor Drainage**: No gravel or drain connection
- **Improper Sizing**: Wells too small or shallow
- **Wall Separation**: Pulling away from foundation
- **No Covers**: Debris accumulation and water pooling
- **Deterioration**: Rusted metal or crumbling materials

## Toronto's Window Well Challenges

### Local Factors Affecting Window Wells

Our climate creates unique challenges:

- **Heavy Rainfall**: 847mm annually overwhelming drainage

### Building Code Requirements

Toronto regulations mandate:
- Minimum 760mm (30") projection from foundation
