faq:
  - question: How fast can local basement leaking repair contractors respond near me?
    answer: >-
      As your neighborhood basement specialists since 1999, we maintain local
      crews throughout Toronto for rapid response: Downtown/Central (30 min),
      North York/Scarborough/Etobicoke (45 min), Mississauga/Markham (60-90
      min). Unlike distant contractors, our trucks are already in your area. 25+
      years serving your neighbors with 2-hour response guarantee anywhere in
      GTA.
  - question: What Toronto homeowners should do while waiting for local basement repair?
    answer: >-
      Safety first - shut off electricity to affected basement areas. Move
      valuables to higher ground and take photos for insurance. Don't use
      regular vacuums on standing water. Identify water source but don't attempt
      DIY repairs - Toronto's clay soil and foundation types require
      professional expertise. Our local crews carry specialized equipment for
      Toronto-specific basement problems.
  - question: >-
      What do local Toronto basement leaking repairs cost compared to other
      contractors?
    answer: >-
      Our local Toronto pricing is competitive: emergency water control
      $600-$2,000, leak stopping $300-$1,500, permanent repairs $1,000-$25,000.
      As established local contractors (since 1999), we don't charge travel fees
      like distant companies. Emergency call-out $200-$350 applies to repair
      costs. Transparent pricing, insurance direct billing, financing available.
  - question: >-
      Do local Toronto contractors work weekends and holidays for basement
      emergencies?
    answer: >-
      Yes - as local Toronto specialists since 1999, we provide 24/7 service
      every day including weekends and statutory holidays. Water damage doesn't
      respect business hours, and neither do we. Our local crews are positioned
      throughout Toronto neighborhoods for immediate response. Weekend/holiday
      surcharges ($100-$300) but immediate property protection is our priority.
  - question: Can local Toronto experts stop basement leaking immediately upon arrival?
    answer: >-
      Yes - our local crews carry Toronto-specific repair materials including
      hydraulic cement for clay soil conditions, professional sealants for
      heritage foundations, and high-capacity pumps. 25+ years experience with
      Toronto basement types means we stop most leaking within the first hour.
      Permanent solutions follow emergency control.
  - question: Do Toronto insurance companies cover local basement leaking repairs?
    answer: >-
      Most Toronto insurance policies cover emergency water extraction and
      temporary repairs. As established local contractors since 1999, we work
      with all major Canadian insurers including Intact, Aviva, TD, State Farm,
      and Co-operators. We provide detailed documentation, direct billing when
      possible, and help navigate claims. Our local reputation helps with
      insurance approval.
  - question: What causes basement leaking in Toronto homes specifically?
    answer: >-
      Toronto-specific causes include: clay soil expansion/contraction cracking
      foundations, high water table from Lake Ontario proximity, overwhelmed
      1960s-80s subdivision drainage, heritage home stone foundation
      deterioration, construction vibration from ongoing development, spring
      thaw pressure, and summer storm overwhelm. Our 25+ years local experience
      quickly identifies Toronto-specific problems.
  - question: Do local Toronto basement contractors guarantee their repair work?
    answer: >-
      Yes - all our emergency repairs include 30-day warranty, with permanent
      repairs carrying 10-year to lifetime warranties. As established Toronto
      contractors since 1999, our reputation depends on standing behind our
      work. Unlike fly-by-night contractors, we'll be here to honor warranties.
      3,500+ completed local repairs demonstrate our commitment to Toronto
      homeowners.
  - question: Which Toronto neighborhoods do you serve for basement leaking repair?
    answer: >-
      We're local Toronto specialists serving every neighborhood: Downtown Core,
      The Beaches, Rosedale, Forest Hill, North York (Willowdale, Don Mills),
      Scarborough (Agincourt, Bendale), Etobicoke (Mimico, New Toronto), plus
      Mississauga, Markham, Brampton, Vaughan. 25+ years serving these exact
      neighborhoods means we understand your specific area's foundation
      challenges.
  - question: >-
      Do local Toronto contractors prevent future leaking or just fix current
      problems?
    answer: >-
      As neighborhood specialists since 1999, we focus on comprehensive
      solutions, not just quick fixes. During emergency response, we stop
      immediate water AND identify root causes specific to Toronto conditions
      (clay soil, water table, heritage foundations). We develop long-term
      prevention plans and can upgrade emergency repairs to permanent
      waterproofing systems using our 25+ years Toronto experience.
