      Getting an underpinning permit in Toronto isn't just bureaucracy - it's a
      complex process designed to prevent catastrophic failures. One missing
      document, one incorrect calculation, or one unsigned form can delay your
      project by months. This guide walks you through every requirement, every
      form, and every inspection.


      We've shepherded hundreds of underpinning permits through Toronto's
      system. We know what building examiners look for, which engineers the city
      trusts, and how to avoid the common pitfalls that cause rejections.
      Whether you're a homeowner trying to understand the process or a
      contractor new to underpinning, this guide provides the roadmap.


      Remember: Starting underpinning without permits isn't just illegal - it's
      dangerous and can make your property unmortgageable and unsellable.

      ### Keys to Permit Success


      **Start Early**

      The permit process takes months, not weeks. Begin immediately after
      deciding to underpin.


      **Hire Professionals**

      Experienced engineers and contractors navigate the system efficiently,
      avoiding costly mistakes.


      **Be Thorough**

      Complete applications get approved faster. Missing documents cause weeks
      of delays.


      **Stay Engaged**

      Respond to city comments quickly. Delayed responses push you to the back
      of the queue.


      **Document Everything**

      Keep copies of all submissions, correspondence, and approvals. You'll need
      them for years.


      **Remember:**

      The permit process protects you, your neighbors, and your investment.
      While frustrating, it ensures safe, legal construction that maintains your
      property value and mortgageability.
faq:
  - question: How long does it take to get an underpinning permit in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Typically 6-12 weeks from submission to approval. This includes 2-4 weeks
      for application preparation, 10-15 business days for initial review, and
      5-10 days for each revision cycle. Complex projects or those requiring
      variances can take 3-4 months.
  - question: What does an underpinning permit cost in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Permit fees are $170.07 per $1,000 of construction value with a minimum
      fee of $198.59. For a typical $40,000 underpinning project, expect permit
      fees around $6,800. Additional costs include engineering ($3,000-10,000),
      surveys, and potential development charges.
  - question: Do I need an engineer for underpinning permits?
    answer: >-
      Yes, a Professional Engineer (P.Eng) licensed in Ontario is mandatory.
      They must prepare sealed drawings, calculations, and commit to general
      review. The engineer will design the underpinning, supervise construction,
      and certify completion. This is non-negotiable for permit approval.
  - question: What documents are required for an underpinning permit?
    answer: >-
      Required documents include: building permit application, Schedule 1 & 2
      forms, 6 sets of engineering drawings, property survey, geotechnical
      report, structural calculations, party wall agreements (if applicable),
      insurance certificates, and WSIB clearance. All must be current and
      properly signed.
  - question: When do I need a party wall agreement?
    answer: >-
      Party wall agreements are required for semi-detached homes, townhouses,
      zero lot line properties, or when excavating within 45 degrees of a
      neighbor's foundation. The agreement must be signed by both parties and
      submitted with your permit application.
  - question: What inspections are required during underpinning?
    answer: >-
      Mandatory inspections include: excavation (before shoring), reinforcement
      (before concrete), concrete placement (during pour), backfill (compaction
      testing), and final inspection. Each requires 48 hours notice and some
      require the engineer present.
  - question: Can I start underpinning work before getting a permit?
    answer: >-
      No. Starting without a permit is illegal and dangerous. Consequences
      include stop work orders, fines up to $50,000, forced removal of work,
      inability to sell or mortgage property, and potential criminal charges if
      someone is injured.
  - question: What if my underpinning project needs a zoning variance?
    answer: >-
      Zoning variances require Committee of Adjustment approval, adding 3-4
      months to your timeline. This costs $3,000-5,000 and requires neighbor
      notification. Common triggers include exceeding floor space index or
      creating basement apartments.
  - question: Can any contractor pull an underpinning permit?
    answer: >-
      No. Contractors must have a City of Toronto business license, appropriate
      trade licenses, $2 million liability insurance minimum, WSIB clearance,
      and a clean record. Using unlicensed contractors results in permit denial
      and legal liability.
  - question: What happens if my permit application is rejected?
    answer: >-
      Rejections usually result from incomplete drawings, missing calculations,
      or inadequate documentation. You'll receive specific comments to address.
      Resubmission typically takes 5-10 days for review. Multiple rounds of
      revisions are common for complex projects.
