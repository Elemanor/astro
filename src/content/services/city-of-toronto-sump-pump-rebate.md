faq:
  - question: How much is the City of Toronto sump pump rebate?

      installation costs up to the maximum. You can combine this with a
      backwater valve rebate for up to $3,400 total.
  - question: Who qualifies for Toronto's sump pump rebate?
    answer: >-
      Toronto residential property owners qualify, including single-family
      homes, semis, and townhouses. The property must be within Toronto
      boundaries, the sump pump must be permanently installed by a licensed
      contractor, and you cannot have received a previous rebate for the same
      device.
  - question: How do I apply for the basement flooding subsidy?
    answer: >-
      Apply online at Toronto.ca within 60 days of installation. Submit itemized
      invoices, proof of payment, before/after photos, and permit documentation.
      The City reviews applications in 4-6 weeks, with rebate cheques issued in
      8-12 weeks after approval.
  - question: Can I install the sump pump myself and get the rebate?
    answer: >-
      No, DIY installations do not qualify for the rebate. The sump pump must be
      installed by a licensed plumber or contractor to ensure code compliance
      and proper installation. The City requires professional invoices as part
      of the application.
  - question: What does the sump pump rebate cover?
    answer: >-
      The rebate covers the sump pump unit, pit installation, discharge piping,
      check valve, electrical connection, concrete work, and labor. It can also
      include battery backup systems and water alarms. The rebate does not cover
      DIY labor or finishing work.
  - question: Can I get rebates for both sump pump and backwater valve?
    answer: >-
      Yes, you can combine rebates for maximum flood protection. Installing both
      a sump pump ($1,750) and backwater valve ($1,750) can get you up to $3,400
      in total rebates. Many contractors recommend both for comprehensive
      protection.
  - question: How long does the rebate process take?
    answer: >-
      The complete rebate process takes 12-18 weeks: Submit application within
      60 days of installation, City review takes 4-6 weeks, and rebate cheques
      are mailed 8-12 weeks after approval. Some applications process faster if
      documentation is complete.
  - question: Do condos qualify for the sump pump rebate?
    answer: >-
      Individual condo units do not qualify as the building's flood protection
      is the condominium corporation's responsibility. However, condo
      corporations may be eligible for commercial flood protection programs.
      Townhouse condos may qualify if individually owned.
  - question: 'What if my sump pump installation costs less than $1,750?'
    answer: >-
      The rebate covers 80% of actual costs up to $1,750 maximum. If your
      installation costs $2,000, you receive $1,600. If it costs $1,500, you
      receive $1,200. Only installations costing $2,187.50 or more receive the
      full $1,750.
  - question: Does the rebate cover sump pump replacement?
    answer: >-
      The rebate only covers new installations or replacement of failed sump
      pumps. Upgrading a working pump doesn't qualify. If your existing pump has
      failed, keep documentation of the failure to support your rebate
      application.
