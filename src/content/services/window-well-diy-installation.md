    content: >
      Window wells are essential features that transform dark basements into
      livable spaces while providing crucial emergency exits. A properly
      installed window well brings natural light, ventilation, and safety to
      below-grade spaces. However, improper window well installation creates
      water problems, safety hazards, and code violations. Done right, window
      wells are valuable assets. Done wrong, they become expensive swimming
      pools attached to your foundation.


      This guide provides exact specifications for code-compliant window well
      installation in Toronto. We'll cover sizing requirements, drainage
      essentials, proper materials, and the installation process that keeps
      water out while letting light in.


      Whether you're creating an egress window for a bedroom or simply want more
      natural light, proper window well installation is critical for safety,
      function, and preventing water damage.

      **Your window well is only as good as its drainage. Focus on water
      management and everything else falls into place.**
faq:
  - question: What size window well do I need for my basement window?
    answer: >-
      Minimum width is window width plus 150mm (6 inches) on each side.
      Projection from wall should be 400-600mm (16-24 inches) for standard
      wells, or 760mm (30 inches) minimum for egress wells. Depth should extend
      100-150mm below the window sill.
  - question: Do I need a permit to install a window well?
    answer: >-
      Usually yes, especially for egress window wells or if you're connecting to
      drainage systems. Check with your local building department. Even if not
      required, following code requirements protects you legally and ensures
      safety.
  - question: How deep should I dig for proper window well drainage?
    answer: >-
      Excavate 300mm (12 inches) below window sill level, plus another 450mm (18
      inches) for drainage gravel - total depth typically 750mm (30 inches)
      minimum. This provides adequate drainage capacity and prevents water from
      reaching the window.
  - question: Can I install a window well without connecting to drainage?
    answer: >-
      No. Ontario Building Code requires positive drainage for all window wells.
      Options include connecting to weeping tile, running to a sump pump, or
      installing a French drain system. Wells without drainage will flood.
  - question: When is a ladder required in a window well?
    answer: >-
      Ladders are mandatory when well depth exceeds 900mm (36 inches) and for
      all egress window wells regardless of depth. The ladder must be permanent,
      with rungs maximum 300mm (12 inches) apart.
  - question: What type of gravel should I use in the window well?
    answer: >-
      Use clear 3/4 inch (19mm) drainage stone only. Never use crusher run or
      any material with fines that can clog drainage. You need 450mm (18 inches)
      of clear stone in the bottom for proper drainage.
  - question: How do I prevent my window well from filling with water?
    answer: >-
      Ensure positive drainage to weeping tile or sump, use only clear drainage
      stone, install filter fabric to prevent clogging, grade soil away from
      well, maintain 2% slope minimum, and keep drains clear of debris.
  - question: What's the best material for window wells?
    answer: >-
      Galvanized steel wells are most common and durable. Composite materials
      resist rust but cost more. Avoid corrugated steel for permanent
      installation. Choose based on your budget and aesthetic preferences.
  - question: How much weight must a window well cover support?
    answer: >-
      Building code requires covers to support minimum 1.9 kPa (40 pounds per
      square foot). For reference, this handles typical snow loads and prevents
      falls. Covers must also open easily from inside without tools.
  - question: Can I install a window well against my property line?
    answer: >-
      Check local bylaws for setback requirements. Most municipalities require
      window wells to be set back from property lines. Even if allowed, consider
      neighbor relations and future maintenance access needs.
