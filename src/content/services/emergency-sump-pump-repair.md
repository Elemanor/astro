faq:
  - question: How often should sump pumps be replaced?
    answer: >-
      Sump pumps typically last 7-10 years with proper maintenance. We recommend
      annual inspections and testing to ensure reliability when you need it
      most.
  - question: Do I need a battery backup sump pump?
    answer: >-
      Yes, battery backup is essential in Toronto. Power outages often coincide
      with severe storms when pumping is critical. Backup systems prevent
      flooding during outages.
  - question: What size sump pump do I need?
    answer: >-
      Pump size depends on water volume, pit size, and discharge height. Our
      experts calculate the exact capacity needed for your specific situation.
  - question: Can I install a sump pump myself?
    answer: >-
      While possible, professional installation ensures proper sizing,
      placement, electrical safety, and code compliance. DIY mistakes can lead
      to flooding and void insurance coverage.
