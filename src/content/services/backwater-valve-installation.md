# Backwater Valve Toronto Rebate & Installation Guide

## Protect Your Home from Sewage Backup - Get Up to $3,400 Back

Nothing ruins a home faster than raw sewage flooding your basement. When city sewers overwhelm during storms, that waste has nowhere to go but back up your pipes and into your lowest drains. The damage is catastrophic - not just financially, but to your family's health and your peace of mind.

A properly installed backwater valve is your last line of defense against this nightmare. This simple device automatically seals your sewer line when backflow threatens, keeping sewage where it belongs - out of your home. With Toronto's aging infrastructure and increasing extreme weather, it's not a question of if sewage backup will threaten your home, but when.

This guide covers everything about backwater valves - how they work, installation requirements, costs, city rebates, and why every Toronto homeowner needs this critical protection.

## What Is a Backwater Valve?

### Your Defense Against Sewage Backup

**Simple Definition:**
A backwater valve is a one-way valve installed in your sewer line that allows wastewater to flow out but automatically closes to prevent sewage from backing up into your home.

**How It Works:**
```
Normal Operation:
House → Valve (Open) → City Sewer
Wastewater flows out freely

During Backup:
City Sewer → Valve (Closes) → Protection
Sewage cannot enter home
```

**Types of Backwater Valves:**

**Mainline Backwater Valve:**
- Protects entire home
- Installed on main sewer line
- Most comprehensive protection
- Eligible for backwater valve Toronto rebate
- Professional installation required for City of Toronto basement flooding protection subsidy

**Fixture Backwater Valves:**
- Protects single fixtures
- Installed at specific drains
- Limited protection
- Less expensive
- Supplement to mainline

**Components:**
1. **Valve body** (cast iron or PVC)
2. **Flapper gate** (seals when needed)
3. **Access cover** (for maintenance)
4. **O-ring seals** (watertight closure)
