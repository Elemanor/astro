    content: >
      Let's be crystal clear: underpinning is NOT a DIY project. This guide
      exists to show you exactly why. We'll cover every code requirement,
      engineering specification, and technical detail - not so you can attempt
      it yourself, but so you understand the complexity and danger involved.


      Every year, we see DIY underpinning disasters. Collapsed foundations.
      Crushed homeowners. Insurance denials. Criminal charges. This isn't
      fear-mongering - it's reality. Underpinning involves temporarily removing
      your home's support. One mistake and your house literally falls down.


      Read this guide to understand the process, appreciate the complexity, and
      make an informed decision to hire professionals.

  - title: The Underpinning Process - Why It's So Dangerous
    content: |
      ### Understanding the Complexity

      **Step 1: Pre-Construction Phase**
      - Neighbor notifications (Party Wall Act)
      - Utility locates (gas, water, electric)
      - Permit applications
      - Insurance notifications
      - Structural monitoring installation
      - Excavation planning
      - Material ordering
      - Equipment staging

      **Step 2: Sequential Excavation**

      **The 3-4 Foot Rule:**
      - NEVER excavate more than 3-4 feet at once
      - NEVER excavate adjacent sections
      - ALWAYS maintain 2/3 support minimum
      - Typical sequence: 1, 5, 9, 13, then 3, 7, 11, 15

      **Why This Matters:**
      ```
      Supported ████ Excavated ░░░░

      Wrong Way (House Collapses):
      ░░░░░░░░░░░░████████████

      Right Way (Sequential):
      ████░░░░████░░░░████░░░░
      ```

      **Step 3: Shoring and Support**
      - Engineered shoring systems
      - Hydraulic jacks precisely placed
      - Load monitoring equipment
      - Daily adjustment requirements
      - Weather considerations
  - title: Excavation Specifications
    content: |
      ### The Most Dangerous Phase

      **Depth Requirements:**
      - Typical residential: 6-8 feet
      - Below existing footing: mandatory
      - Frost line consideration: 4 feet minimum
      - Drainage accommodation: additional depth

      **Excavation Hazards:**
      - **Cave-in Risk**: Soil can collapse instantly
      - **Undermining**: Remove support = collapse
      - **Water Infiltration**: Pumping requirements
      - **Utility Strikes**: Gas leaks, electrocution
      - **Adjacent Properties**: Neighbor foundations

      **OSHA Requirements (Yes, They Apply):**
      - Trench box for workers
      - Ladder access every 25 feet
      - Daily inspections
      - Competent person on-site
      - Emergency rescue plan

      **Soil Behavior:**
      - Clay: Stands vertical briefly, then fails
      - Sand: Immediate collapse risk
      - Wet conditions: Exponentially dangerous
      - Frozen soil: False security
  - title: Concrete Specifications

      ### Why This Guide Exists


      We wrote this guide not to enable DIY underpinning, but to prevent
      disasters. Every technical detail, every code requirement, every
      specification shows why this work requires professionals.


      **Underpinning is:**

      - Temporarily removing your home's support

      - Risking catastrophic collapse

      - Requiring engineering expertise

      - Demanding specialized equipment

      - Needing experienced judgment

      - Carrying massive liability


      **The Math Doesn't Work:**

      - Professional cost: $40,000

      - DIY cost: $35,000-50,000

      - Risk assumed: Total loss of home

      - Savings: None to negative

      - Conclusion: Hire professionals


      **Your House Deserves Better**

      Your home is your biggest investment. Your family's safety is priceless.
      Don't risk everything to save nothing. Professional underpinning protects
      both.
faq:
  - question: Can I legally underpin my own house in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      While not explicitly illegal for homeowners, you MUST obtain permits, hire
      a structural engineer, and pass multiple inspections. The engineering
      alone costs $5,000-10,000. Without proper permits and engineering, it's
      illegal and your insurance is void.
  - question: How much would DIY underpinning actually save?
    answer: >-
      Nothing. Professional underpinning costs about $40,000. DIY costs include:
      engineering ($5,000-10,000), permits ($2,000-5,000), equipment rental
      ($20,000+), materials ($10,000+), and disposal ($5,000+). Total:
      $35,000-50,000, with catastrophic risk.
  - question: What happens if my DIY underpinning fails?
    answer: >-
      Consequences include: house collapse (partial or total), insurance claim
      denial, criminal charges if anyone is injured, lawsuits from damage,
      mortgage called due, property becomes unsaleable, and potential
      bankruptcy. The city can also condemn your home.
  - question: Why is the 3-4 foot excavation rule so important?
    answer: >-
      Excavating more than 3-4 feet at once removes too much support, risking
      immediate collapse. Your house weighs 100+ tons - that weight must be
      continuously supported. Professional contractors never exceed this limit
      and never excavate adjacent sections.
  - question: Can I hire day laborers to help with underpinning?
    answer: >-
      This dramatically increases liability. If someone is injured or killed,
      you face criminal charges and lawsuits. Professional contractors carry $5
      million insurance and worker's compensation. One injury could cost you
      everything.
  - question: What engineering is actually required for underpinning?
    answer: >-
      Required engineering includes: load calculations, soil analysis,
      excavation sequencing, shoring design, footing specifications,
      reinforcement schedules, and monitoring protocols. This requires a
      structural engineer, costing $5,000-10,000 minimum.
  - question: Why can't I just dig carefully and pour concrete?
    answer: >-
      Underpinning isn't just digging and pouring. It requires: sequential
      excavation planning, continuous load support, engineered concrete mix,
      proper reinforcement, structural connections, waterproofing integration,
      and precise backfilling. One mistake causes catastrophic failure.
  - question: What special equipment do professionals use?
    answer: >-
      Professionals use: engineered shoring systems, hydraulic jacks, laser
      monitoring equipment, concrete pumps, compaction equipment, and
      specialized excavation tools. Renting this equipment costs $20,000+ and
      requires training to operate safely.
  - question: Is underpinning covered by homeowner's insurance?
    answer: >-
      Insurance specifically excludes earth movement and foundation work. If
      your DIY underpinning fails, insurance won't cover the damage. Worse,
      attempting it yourself may void your entire policy, leaving you completely
      unprotected.
  - question: 'After reading this, should I attempt DIY underpinning?'
    answer: >-
      Absolutely not. This guide exists to show why underpinning requires
      professionals. The cost savings are minimal to negative, while risks
      include total home loss, criminal charges, and bankruptcy. Hire insured
      professionals with experience and proper equipment.
