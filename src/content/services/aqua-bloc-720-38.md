faq:
  - question: What makes Aqua Bloc 720-38 better than other waterproofing membranes?
    answer: >-
      Aqua Bloc 720-38 offers superior crack-bridging ability (1,800%
      elongation), self-healing properties, seamless application, and 30+ year
      life expectancy. Its rubberized asphalt formula creates a permanent bond
      to concrete and maintains flexibility in extreme temperatures.
  - question: How much does Aqua Bloc 720-38 installation cost?
    answer: >-
      Professional Aqua Bloc installation costs $10-16 per square foot including
      materials, labor, and protection board. While premium-priced, it offers
      superior protection and longevity compared to alternatives, making it
      cost-effective long-term.
  - question: Can Aqua Bloc 720-38 be applied in cold weather?
    answer: >-
      Yes, Aqua Bloc can be applied in temperatures as low as 4°C (40°F), making
      it suitable for year-round installation in Toronto. The material remains
      workable in cold conditions, unlike many hot-applied systems.
  - question: How long does Aqua Bloc 720-38 last?
    answer: >-
      Properly installed Aqua Bloc 720-38 has a life expectancy of 30+ years.
      The material maintains its waterproofing properties and flexibility
      throughout its service life, backed by manufacturer warranties up to 20
      years.
  - question: Is Aqua Bloc 720-38 environmentally safe?
    answer: >-
      Yes, Aqua Bloc 720-38 is VOC compliant, contains no hazardous solvents,
      and is safe for applicators and occupants. It's LEED compliant and doesn't
      off-gas after installation, making it environmentally responsible.
  - question: Can Aqua Bloc be applied over existing waterproofing?
    answer: >-
      Generally, old waterproofing must be removed for proper adhesion. Aqua
      Bloc requires a clean, sound substrate to form its permanent bond.
      However, each situation requires professional assessment to determine the
      best approach.
  - question: What's the warranty on Aqua Bloc 720-38?
    answer: >-
      Tremco offers 10-20 year material warranties depending on the installation
      and inspection program. We provide lifetime labor warranties on our
      installations, creating comprehensive coverage that's transferable to new
      owners.
  - question: How thick is Aqua Bloc 720-38 when applied?
    answer: >-
      Aqua Bloc 720-38 is applied at 60 mils wet thickness, drying to 38 mils.
      This provides optimal waterproofing performance while maintaining
      flexibility. Professional installation ensures consistent thickness
      throughout.
  - question: Does Aqua Bloc 720-38 require protection board?
    answer: >-
      Yes, protection board is essential to prevent damage during backfilling
      and provide drainage. It's a critical component of the system and included
      in professional installations to ensure long-term performance.
  - question: Can Aqua Bloc seal active leaks?
    answer: >-
      While Aqua Bloc provides excellent waterproofing for new applications,
      active leaks must be stopped first. The surface must be merely damp, not
      flowing with water, for proper adhesion and performance.
