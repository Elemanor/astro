faq:
  - question: What's the average cost to underpin a basement in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      The average cost to underpin a basement in Toronto is $49,000-70,000 for a
      typical 30x40 foot home (140 linear feet). This works out to $350-500 per
      linear foot and includes all excavation, underpinning, waterproofing, and
      a new concrete floor.
  - question: Why does underpinning cost vary so much?
    answer: >-
      Underpinning costs vary based on soil conditions (rock adds
      $100-200/linear foot), access restrictions (limited access adds 20-30%),
      foundation type (stone foundations cost 15-20% more), depth requirements,
      and seasonal factors. Get a detailed quote for accurate pricing.
  - question: What's included in underpinning cost estimates?
    answer: >-
      Professional underpinning quotes include: engineering and permits
      ($3,000-5,000), excavation and disposal, structural underpinning work,
      waterproofing and drainage, new concrete floor with vapor barrier, basic
      utility relocations, and warranty. Finishing work is additional.
  - question: How do I finance basement underpinning?
    answer: >-
      Most homeowners use home equity lines of credit (HELOC) with interest-only
      payments during construction. Other options include refinancing to access
      equity, construction loans, or payment plans. Rental income often covers
      loan payments making it cash-flow positive.
  - question: Is underpinning worth the cost?
    answer: >-
      Yes, underpinning typically provides 200-300% ROI. Creating 1,200 sq ft of
      space worth $200-400/sq ft adds $240,000-480,000 in value for a $60,000
      investment. Plus rental income of $2,500-3,500/month provides ongoing
      returns.
  - question: How accurate are underpinning estimates?
    answer: >-
      Professional estimates are typically accurate within 10% for standard
      conditions. Unexpected issues like rock, old foundations, or buried
      obstacles can add costs. Reputable contractors include contingencies and
      discuss potential extras upfront.
  - question: Can I reduce underpinning costs?
    answer: >-
      While you can't compromise structural work, you can reduce overall project
      costs by: doing your own finishing work later, choosing basic
      waterproofing over premium, scheduling during slower seasons, or
      considering bench footing (though this loses space).
  - question: Do underpinning costs include permits?
    answer: >-
      Quality contractors include permit costs ($1,500-3,000) in their quotes.
      This covers building permits, engineer reviews, and required inspections.
      Be wary of quotes that exclude permits as this indicates corners may be
      cut.
  - question: How much extra for a walkout basement?
    answer: >-
      Adding a walkout entrance during underpinning costs an additional
      $15,000-25,000. This includes excavation, retaining walls, stairs, doors,
      and drainage. It's most cost-effective when done with underpinning rather
      than later.
  - question: What hidden costs should I watch for?
    answer: >-
      Potential additional costs include: rock removal ($100-200/linear foot),
      high water table pumping ($5,000-10,000), contaminated soil disposal,
      party wall agreements ($2,000-3,000), and engineering changes. Discuss
      these possibilities upfront.
