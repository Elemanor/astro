faq:
  - question: What makes foundation waterproofing in Mississauga different from Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Mississauga's unique challenges include proximity to Lake Ontario creating
      high water table conditions, Credit River and tributary drainage patterns,
      newer subdivision development with drainage issues, and different soil
      compositions from sandy lakefront to clay inland areas. Our
      Mississauga-specific solutions address these exact conditions with 15+
      years of local experience.
  - question: How much does foundation waterproofing cost in Mississauga?
    answer: >-
      Mississauga foundation waterproofing costs vary by area and home type:
      Port Credit/Lakefront ($4,800-$14,000), City Centre ($4,200-$12,500),
      Meadowvale/New Areas ($3,800-$11,500), Erin Mills/Credit Valley
      ($4,000-$12,000). Factors include foundation age, soil conditions, lake
      proximity, and system requirements. We provide detailed written estimates
      with no hidden fees.
  - question: Do you handle Mississauga building permits?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we handle all permit applications with the City of Mississauga,
      including building permits for excavation, electrical permits for sump
      pumps, and plumbing permits for drainage. Our established relationships
      with Mississauga building departments ensure smooth processing and faster
      project starts.
  - question: What Mississauga rebate programs are available?
    answer: >-
      Mississauga offers the Residential Flood Reduction Program with rebates up
      to $2,800 for qualifying waterproofing work including sump pumps,
      backwater valves, and foundation protection. We handle all rebate
      paperwork and ensure maximum rebate eligibility for Mississauga residents.
  - question: Can you work near the Credit River and Lake Ontario?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely. We have extensive experience with waterproofing homes near the
      Credit River, Lake Ontario, and other Mississauga waterways. Our
      specialized lake shore and river proximity solutions address high water
      table conditions, seasonal flooding risks, and moisture infiltration
      challenges unique to waterfront properties.
  - question: How do you compete with Toronto-based companies in Mississauga?
    answer: >-
      We offer superior Mississauga service: faster local response times,
      intimate knowledge of Mississauga soil/water conditions, established
      relationships with local Mississauga suppliers and inspectors, competitive
      Mississauga pricing, and ongoing local presence for warranty service. Our
      Mississauga focus means better results for Mississauga homeowners.

      and all surrounding areas with same-day service availability.
  - question: How long does foundation waterproofing take in Mississauga?
    answer: >-
      Timeline varies by system type and Mississauga-specific factors: Interior
      systems (2-4 days), Exterior systems (5-8 days weather permitting).
      Mississauga projects often complete efficiently due to our local supplier
      relationships, material availability, and familiarity with Mississauga
      permit processes.
  - question: What warranty do you provide for Mississauga projects?
    answer: >-
      We provide comprehensive warranty coverage for all Mississauga projects:
      Lifetime material warranty, 25-year labor warranty, transferable coverage
      for home sales, annual inspections included, 24/7 emergency support, and
