    content: |
      Beautiful yards mean nothing if water pools against your foundation. After decades of basement waterproofing and foundation work, we understand that proper landscaping and drainage prevents most water problems. Why fix basements when proper grading prevents issues entirely?

      We approach landscaping differently - beauty meets function. Every project starts with drainage analysis because Toronto's clay soil and weather patterns demand it. Flowers are nice, but dry basements are essential.

      Our landscaping and drainage services include:
      - Complete property grading and slope correction
      - French drain installation and drainage systems
      - Downspout extensions and management
      - Swale creation and water redirection
      - Driveway drainage solutions
      - Landscape restoration after construction
      - Sod installation with proper base preparation
      - Strategic planting for foundation protection

      Every project protects your home's foundation while enhancing curb appeal.
  - title: "Drainage Problems We Solve"
    content: |
      **Water Pooling Near Foundation**
      The most dangerous drainage issue. Water sitting against your foundation leads to:
      - Basement flooding
      - Foundation cracks
      - Structural damage
      - Mold growth
      - Expensive repairs

      We regrade to ensure positive drainage away from your home - minimum 6 inches drop over 10 feet.

      **Soggy Lawns and Standing Water**
      Toronto's clay soil doesn't drain naturally. Low spots become permanent puddles. We solve through:
      - Strategic grading
      - French drain installation
      - Dry well systems
      - Proper soil amendment
      - Catch basin placement

      **Driveway and Walkway Flooding**
      Improper slopes send water toward homes instead of away. We correct:
      - Driveway pitch issues
      - Sidewalk settlement
      - Patio drainage problems
      - Garage entrance flooding
      - Ice formation zones

      **Neighbor Water Issues**
      When surrounding properties drain onto yours, diplomatic solutions include:
      - Swales along property lines
      - Retaining walls with drainage
      - Catch basins at low points
      - Underground drainage systems
      - Legal compliance throughout

      **Downspout Disasters**
      Disconnected or short downspouts dump roof water at your foundation. We install:
      - Extended discharge lines
      - Underground connections
      - Pop-up emitters
      - Splash blocks
      - Rain barrel systems

      **The Foundation of Good Drainage**

      Proper grading requires more than moving dirt around:

      **Site Analysis**
      We start by understanding your property:
      - Existing slopes and elevations
      - Soil composition testing
      - Water flow patterns
      - Problem area identification
      - Underground utility marking

      **Grading Plan Development**
      Every property needs custom solutions:
      - Calculate required slopes
      - Plan material quantities
      - Design drainage paths
      - Integrate with landscaping
      - Consider neighboring properties

      **Professional Execution**
      - Strip and preserve topsoil
      - Establish proper base grades
      - Compact in appropriate lifts
      - Install drainage where needed
      - Replace topsoil properly
      - Final grade to exact slopes

      **Quality Details**
      - Minimum 2% slope away from foundation
      - 6" drop in first 10 feet critical
      - Swales for water direction
      - No low spots or bird baths
      - Smooth transitions throughout

      Without proper grading, all other drainage efforts fail.
  - title: "French Drain Systems"

      **Underground Water Management**

      When surface grading isn't enough, French drains provide subsurface drainage:

      **Professional French Drain Installation:**
      1. **Excavation** - Proper depth and slope (1% minimum)
      2. **Gravel Base** - Clean 3/4" stone for flow
      3. **Perforated Pipe** - Rigid PVC, not flexible corrugated
      4. **Filter Fabric** - Prevents soil infiltration
      5. **More Gravel** - Surrounding pipe completely
      6. **Fabric Wrap** - Burrito wrap technique
      7. **Backfill** - Appropriate material selection
      8. **Surface Restoration** - Seamless integration

      **Common Applications:**
      - Along foundation walls
      - Behind retaining walls
      - Across soggy yards
      - Under driveways
      - Around pool areas
      - Sport court drainage

      **Discharge Options:**
      - Storm sewers (where permitted)
      - Dry wells for infiltration
      - Daylight to lower areas
      - Rain gardens
      - Bioswales

      French drains last decades when installed correctly with quality materials.

      **What We Fix From Others**

      **Surface-Only Solutions**
      Just adding topsoil rarely works:
      - Doesn't address underlying issues
      - Temporary fix at best
      - Water finds original paths
      - Waste of money

      **Improper Slopes**
      Grading requires precision:
      - Too little - water doesn't flow
      - Too much - erosion issues
      - Wrong direction - worse problems
      - Inconsistent - pooling areas

      **Cheap Materials**
      - Corrugated pipe crushes
      - Wrong stone clogs
      - No filter fabric fails
      - Poor connections leak

      **Ignoring Regulations**
      - Illegal storm connections
      - Drainage onto neighbors
      - Permit requirements
      - Easement violations

      We fix these mistakes properly, permanently.

faq:
  - question: "How much slope do I need away from my foundation?"
    answer: "Proper grading requires minimum 6 inches of drop in the first 10 feet from your foundation (2% slope). This ensures water flows away effectively. Steeper slopes may be needed in heavy clay soils."
  - question: "What's the difference between surface drainage and French drains?"
    answer: "Surface drainage uses grading and slopes to direct water away on top of the ground. French drains are underground perforated pipes in gravel that collect and redirect subsurface water. Many properties need both."
  - question: "How long do French drains last?"
    answer: "Properly installed French drains with quality materials last 30-50 years. Key factors include using rigid PVC pipe (not corrugated), proper filter fabric, clean gravel, and correct slope."
  - question: "Can I install drainage myself?"
    answer: "While possible, proper drainage requires understanding slopes, soil types, and water management. Poor installation often makes problems worse. Professional installation ensures lasting solutions and code compliance."
  - question: "Why is my yard always wet?"
    answer: "Toronto's clay soil doesn't drain naturally. Common causes include poor grading, high water tables, neighbor runoff, or inadequate drainage systems. We identify specific causes and implement targeted solutions."
  - question: "Do downspout extensions really help?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Downspouts dumping water near foundations cause many basement water problems. Extending them minimum 6 feet from foundation (preferably 10+) significantly reduces water issues."
  - question: "How much does drainage work cost?"
    answer: "Basic regrading starts around $1,500-3,000. French drains typically cost $40-60 per linear foot installed. Complete drainage solutions range $5,000-15,000 depending on property size and complexity."
  - question: "When is the best time for drainage work?"
    answer: "Spring through fall is ideal for drainage work. Spring reveals winter damage, summer allows proper compaction, and fall prepares for winter. Frozen ground makes winter work difficult and expensive."
  - question: "Will drainage work damage my existing landscaping?"
    answer: "Some disruption is inevitable, but we minimize damage and include restoration in our pricing. We preserve valuable plants when possible and restore or improve landscaping after drainage installation."
  - question: "Do I need permits for drainage work?"
    answer: "Major grading changes and connections to storm sewers require permits. French drains on your property typically don't. We handle all permit requirements and ensure code compliance."
