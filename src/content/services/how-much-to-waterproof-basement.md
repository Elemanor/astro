faq:
  - question: How much does it cost to waterproof a basement in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Basement waterproofing in Toronto costs $3,000-8,000 for interior systems
      and $15,000-25,000 for exterior waterproofing. The average homeowner
      spends $7,000-12,000 for comprehensive protection. Costs vary based on
      basement size, water severity, and chosen solution.
  - question: 'Is $5,000 enough to waterproof a basement?'
    answer: >-
      Yes, $5,000 can cover basic interior waterproofing including drainage
      channels, a sump pump, and vapor barriers for an average-sized basement.
      This provides good protection for minor to moderate water issues. Severe
      problems or exterior work requires larger budgets.
  - question: Why is exterior waterproofing so expensive?
    answer: >-
      Exterior waterproofing costs $15,000-25,000 because it requires excavating
      6-8 feet deep around your entire foundation, multiple waterproof layers,
      new drainage systems, and extensive restoration. The comprehensive nature
      and heavy equipment needs drive costs higher than interior solutions.
  - question: 'Can I waterproof my basement for under $3,000?'
    answer: >-
      Basic waterproofing under $3,000 is possible for small basements with
      minor issues. This might include targeted crack repairs, partial drainage,
      or a basic sump pump. However, comprehensive solutions addressing root
      causes typically cost more.
  - question: How much per square foot to waterproof a basement?
    answer: >-
      Interior waterproofing costs $3-7 per square foot of basement area.
      Exterior waterproofing is priced per linear foot of foundation ($150-250).
      For a 1,000 sq ft basement, expect $3,000-7,000 for interior or
      $15,000-25,000 for exterior solutions.
  - question: Does waterproofing add value to my home?
    answer: >-
      Yes, professional waterproofing typically returns 60-90% of cost at sale
      and makes homes sell faster. A dry basement adds usable space, prevents
      damage, and provides buyer confidence. In Toronto's market, waterproofing
      can add $10,000-30,000 in value.
  - question: What's the cheapest way to waterproof a basement?
    answer: >-
      The cheapest effective solution is interior waterproofing at $3,000-5,000.
      Avoid DIY paints or sealers that fail quickly. Professional interior
      systems cost less than exterior work while providing reliable, warrantied
      protection for most water problems.
  - question: How can I finance basement waterproofing?
    answer: >-
      Financing options include: 0% interest for 12-18 months, home equity loans
      with tax benefits, payment plans with contractors, insurance claims for
      covered damage, and government subsidies up to $3,400. Most homeowners pay
      $150-300 monthly.
  - question: Is it worth waterproofing an old basement?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely. Older basements often need waterproofing most, as original
      methods have failed. Waterproofing prevents ongoing damage, enables
      basement use, maintains home value, and costs far less than ignoring water
      problems. Age makes it more necessary, not less.
  - question: When is the best time to waterproof for lower costs?
    answer: >-
      Late fall and winter often offer 10-15% savings due to lower demand.
      Spring is most expensive due to flooding concerns. Book during dry seasons
      for better prices. However, active water problems should be addressed
      immediately regardless of season.
