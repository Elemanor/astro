## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does Aqua Bloc 720-38 installation take?**
Typical residential installation takes 2-3 days including prep work, application, and protection board installation.

**Can it be applied over existing waterproofing?**
Old waterproofing must be completely removed for proper adhesion. Aqua Bloc 720-38 requires direct contact with the foundation.

**What's the difference between 720-38 and 720-29?**
720-38 is the premium formulation with enhanced flexibility and self-healing properties. 720-29 is the standard grade suitable for less demanding applications.

**Does it work on block foundations?**
Yes, when properly applied with appropriate primer and surface preparation, Aqua Bloc 720-38 adheres excellently to concrete block.

**How soon can I backfill after application?**
Allow 48 hours cure time, then install protection board before backfilling. Never backfill directly against the membrane.
