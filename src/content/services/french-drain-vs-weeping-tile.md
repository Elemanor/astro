    content: |
      The terms "French drain" and "weeping tile" get thrown around interchangeably, but they're not the same thing. This confusion leads to miscommunication, wrong material choices, and failed drainage systems. Understanding the distinction helps you speak intelligently with contractors, order the right materials, and ensure your drainage system actually works.

      In Toronto, this confusion is especially problematic because many homes have old clay weeping tile that needs replacement, while contractors recommend "French drains" without clarifying what they mean. This guide explains the historical origins, technical differences, modern applications, and why terminology matters for your project.
  - title: "Historical Context"
    content: |
      ### How These Terms Evolved

      **Weeping Tile - The Original**
      - Originated in 1800s
      - Made from clay tiles
      - Short sections (12-18")
      - Gaps between sections
      - Water "wept" through joints
      - Agricultural origins
      - Adapted for foundations

      **Original Clay Tile System:**
      ```
      │══│  │══│  │══│  │══│  ← Clay tiles
        ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑    ← Gaps for water entry
      ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓   ← Gravel bed
      ```

      **French Drain - The Concept**
      - Named after Henry French (1859)
      - Agricultural drainage method
      - Gravel-filled trench
      - With or without pipe
      - Surface water management
      - Not specifically for foundations

      **Why Names Stuck:**
      - Weeping tile = foundation drainage (even without tiles)
      - French drain = any gravel drain system
      - Regional preferences vary
      - Industry uses both terms
      - Confusion persists
  - title: "Technical Definitions"
    content: |
      ### What Each Term Really Means

      **WEEPING TILE (Modern Definition)**
      - Foundation perimeter drainage
      - Installed at footing level
      - Perforated pipe system
      - Specifically for foundations
      - Below grade application
      - Part of building code

      **Characteristics:**
      - Location: Against/near footings
      - Depth: Bottom of foundation
      - Purpose: Foundation protection
      - Materials: Modern perforated pipe
      - Code required: Yes

      **FRENCH DRAIN (Proper Definition)**
      - Surface/subsurface drainage
      - Various depths possible
      - May or may not have pipe
      - General water management
      - Multiple applications
      - Not code specific

      **Characteristics:**
      - Location: Anywhere needed
      - Depth: Varies by purpose
      - Purpose: Water interception/redirect
      - Materials: Gravel, sometimes pipe
      - Code required: Sometimes
  - title: "Modern Materials Reality"
    content: |
      ### Both Systems Use Similar Components Now

      **What's Actually Installed Today:**

      **For "Weeping Tile" (Foundation Drainage):**
      - 4" perforated PVC pipe
      - 3/4" clear stone surround
      - Filter fabric protection
      - Connected to sump/discharge
      - No actual clay tiles used

      **For "French Drains" (General Drainage):**
      - 3-4" perforated PVC pipe (usually)
      - 3/4" clear stone fill
      - Filter fabric wrap
      - Various discharge methods
      - Sometimes just gravel

      **The Irony:**
      Modern "weeping tile" contains no tile, and French drains often aren't French drains in the original sense - they're just perforated pipe in gravel.
  - title: "Foundation Drainage Specifics"

      ### What "Weeping Tile" Means Today

      **Code Requirements (OBC 9.14.2):**
      - Minimum 100mm (4") diameter
      - Perforated or open joint pipe
      - Installed at footing level
      - Surround with granular material
      - Connect to positive drainage

      **Installation Standards:**
      ```
      Foundation Wall
           │
           │←─ Waterproofing membrane
           │
           │←─ Drainage mat
      ─────┴─────
      Foundation

                ▓▓▓←─ Clear stone
               ▓▓▓▓▓
      ```

      **Why Still Called Weeping Tile:**
      - Historical terminology
      - Building codes use term
      - Industry standard name
      - Everyone understands it
      - Change would confuse more

      **Modern Best Practice:**
      - 4" rigid PVC perforated
      - Holes facing down
      - Filter fabric protection
      - Proper slope to discharge
      - Cleanout access

      ### Why Terminology Matters

      **When Contractors Say "French Drain":**

      **Ask These Questions:**
      1. Where exactly will it be installed?
      2. What depth are we talking about?
      3. Is this for foundation or surface water?
      4. What materials will you use?
      5. Is this code required?

      **When Contractors Say "Weeping Tile":**

      **Clarify These Points:**
      1. You mean foundation drainage?
      2. Using modern perforated pipe?
      3. At footing level?
      4. Meeting building code?
      5. Connected to what discharge?

      **Avoiding Miscommunication:**
      - Use descriptive terms
      - Specify location clearly
      - Discuss materials explicitly
      - Confirm understanding
      - Get written specifications

      - Maintain properly
  - title: "The Bottom Line"
    content: |
      ### Key Takeaways

      **Historical Terms, Modern Systems:**
      - Weeping tile = foundation drainage (no tiles anymore)
      - French drain = general drainage concept
      - Both use similar materials now
      - Location and purpose differ
      - Terminology causes confusion

      **For Your Project:**
      1. Describe your water problem clearly
      2. Ask contractors to specify exactly what they mean
      3. Confirm depth and location
      4. Get material specifications in writing
      5. Understand code requirements

      **Remember:**
      - Foundation problems need foundation drainage (deep)
      - Surface problems need French drains (shallow)
      - Sometimes you need both
      - Clear communication prevents costly mistakes
      - Right solution matters more than terminology

      **The Name Game:**
      Whether your contractor calls it weeping tile, French drain, foundation drainage, or something else entirely, make sure you're both talking about the same system at the same depth for the same purpose. The words matter less than mutual understanding.
faq:
  - question: "What's the main difference between French drains and weeping tile?"
    answer: "Weeping tile is foundation drainage installed at footing level (6-8 feet deep) to protect basements. French drains are general drainage systems installed at various depths (usually 2-4 feet) for surface water management. Modern weeping tile uses perforated pipe, not actual tiles."
  - question: "Why do contractors use these terms interchangeably?"
    answer: "Historical confusion and regional differences. Both systems now use similar materials (perforated pipe in gravel), but serve different purposes at different depths. Many contractors use 'French drain' as a catch-all term, which causes miscommunication about project scope and cost."
  - question: "Do I need weeping tile or a French drain for my wet basement?"
    answer: "Wet basements require foundation drainage (weeping tile) installed at footing level. French drains are for surface water and won't solve basement water problems. Foundation drainage is code-required and must be installed deep enough to protect the foundation."
  - question: "What materials are used for modern weeping tile?"
    answer: "Modern 'weeping tile' uses 4-inch perforated PVC pipe (not clay tiles), surrounded by 3/4-inch clear stone, wrapped in filter fabric, and connected to a sump pump or storm sewer. The same materials are used for French drains but installed at different depths."
  - question: "How much more expensive is weeping tile than French drains?"
    answer: "Foundation drainage (weeping tile) costs $150-250 per linear foot due to deep excavation (6-8 feet) and waterproofing requirements. French drains cost $30-60 per linear foot for shallow installation (2-4 feet). The depth difference drives the cost variance."
  - question: "Can a French drain replace weeping tile for foundation drainage?"
    answer: "No. French drains installed at shallow depths cannot protect foundations. Building code requires foundation drainage at footing level. Using a French drain instead of proper weeping tile violates code and won't prevent basement water problems."
  - question: "Why is my 100-year-old home's 'weeping tile' made of clay?"
    answer: "Original weeping tile systems used short clay pipe sections with gaps between them for water entry. The name 'weeping tile' comes from water 'weeping' through these gaps. Modern systems use perforated plastic pipe but kept the historical name."
  - question: "How do I communicate clearly with contractors about drainage?"
    answer: "Describe your specific water problem and ask about installation depth. For foundation issues, confirm the contractor means drainage at footing level (6-8 feet). For surface water, confirm French drain depth (2-4 feet). Get specifications in writing."
  - question: "Do French drains require permits in Toronto?"
    answer: "Surface French drains rarely need permits unless they affect grading, property lines, or connect to sewers. Foundation drainage (weeping tile) always requires permits and inspections because it's structural work covered by building code."
  - question: "Can I install a French drain myself but need a contractor for weeping tile?"
    answer: "Yes. French drains for surface water are often DIY-friendly projects. Foundation drainage (weeping tile) requires professional installation due to depth, structural implications, code requirements, and the need for proper waterproofing and engineering considerations."
