  - title: Why Winter Waterproofing Matters
    content: >
      Toronto's harsh winters create unique basement flooding risks that most
      waterproofing companies won't address. Frozen pipes, ice dams, and
      freeze-thaw cycles can cause catastrophic flooding when other contractors
      are hibernating for the season. DrySpace operates year-round with
      specialized winter equipment and cold-weather materials designed for
      Toronto's challenging climate.


      Unlike fair-weather competitors, we maintain heated equipment,
      winter-grade materials, and emergency response capabilities throughout the
      coldest months. When frozen pipes burst or ice dams cause flooding at
      -20¬∞C, we're the only team equipped to respond immediately with solutions
      that work in extreme cold.
  - title: Specialized Winter Services
    content: >
      **Emergency Frozen Pipe Flooding** - Our heated extraction trucks and
      cold-weather pumps work in temperatures down to -30¬∞C, removing flood
      water and preventing freeze damage to equipment.


      **Ice Dam Water Intrusion** - We stop water entry from ice dams using
      heated injection systems and winter-grade sealants that bond in cold
      conditions when standard materials fail.


      **Cold Weather Crack Repair** - Our winter-formulated polyurethane and
      heated injection equipment allow foundation crack repairs even when
      outdoor temperatures are below freezing.


      **Frozen Drain Emergency Service** - When basement drains freeze and cause
      backups, our thawing equipment and backup pumping systems restore drainage
      immediately.
faq:
  - question: Can you really waterproof basements in winter?
    answer: >
      Yes, we specialize in winter waterproofing using heated equipment and
      cold-weather materials. Our winter services include:

      - Interior waterproofing systems installed year-round

      - Heated crack injection (works to -25¬∞C)

      - Emergency flood response with freeze-resistant equipment

      - Winter-grade sealants and membranes

      - Heated workspace tents for exterior work when needed


      We're one of the few Toronto contractors maintaining full winter
      operations with specialized cold-weather capabilities.
  - question: What makes winter basement problems different?
    answer: >
      Winter creates unique risks other seasons don't have:

      - **Frozen pipes** can burst and flood basements instantly

      - **Ice dams** force water into foundations from above

      - **Freeze-thaw cycles** expand existing cracks rapidly

      - **Frozen drains** cause sewage backups

      - **Snow loads** increase foundation pressure


      Standard waterproofing materials and equipment fail in cold weather,
      requiring specialized winter-grade solutions.
  - question: How much does winter waterproofing cost?
    answer: >
      Winter waterproofing costs similar to regular season work:

      - **Emergency winter service**: $500-$2,000

      - **Winter crack injection**: $400-$1,200 per crack

      - **Interior winterization**: $3,000-$8,000

      - **Complete winter system**: $5,000-$12,000


      No winter surcharges - we believe year-round protection shouldn't cost
      extra. Emergency response within 2 hours.
  - question: Do you respond to winter emergencies 24/7?
    answer: >
      Absolutely. Winter emergencies often happen at night or weekends when
      pipes freeze. Our winter emergency response:

      - Available 24/7 including holidays

      - Heated emergency vehicles ready

      - 1-2 hour response in Toronto

      - Specialized cold-weather equipment

      - Direct insurance billing available


      We maintain the GTA's only dedicated winter waterproofing emergency
      service.

**Winter Basement Protection Services:**
- [Cold Weather Emergency Response](/services/emergency-waterproofing/) - 24/7 winter crisis response
- [Frozen Pipe Flood Recovery](/emergency/toronto-emergency-basement-flooding/) - Immediate flood response
- [Winter Foundation Protection](/emergency/winter-foundation-protection/) - Preventive winterization
- [Ice Dam Water Damage](/problems/wet-basement-solutions/) - Interior water management

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Why Most Companies Stop in Winter (But We Don't)

**The Hard Truth About Winter Waterproofing:**

Most Toronto waterproofing contractors disappear from November to April. Their equipment freezes, standard materials fail, and they're simply not equipped for cold weather operations. This leaves homeowners vulnerable during the season when basement flooding risks are actually highest.

**What Makes Winter More Dangerous:**
- Frozen pipes burst without warning
- Ice dams force water into foundations
- Freeze-thaw cycles rapidly expand cracks  
- Snow loads stress foundation walls
- Drainage systems freeze and fail
- Emergency repairs become impossible

**DrySpace's Year-Round Difference:**
- Heated equipment trucks operational to -30¬∞C
- Winter-grade materials that bond in cold
- Emergency crews trained for winter conditions
- Only Toronto contractor with heated injection systems
- Full interior waterproofing capabilities regardless of weather

## Winter-Specific Basement Threats

### üßä Ice Dam Water Intrusion

**The Problem:**
Ice dams form when roof snow melts and refreezes at gutters, forcing water under shingles and into wall cavities. This water eventually reaches foundation level, causing interior flooding that appears to come from nowhere.

**Our Winter Solution:**
- Emergency water extraction with freeze-resistant pumps
- Heated crack injection to stop entry points immediately
- Interior drainage systems installed year-round
- Temporary ice dam removal when safe
- Permanent interior waterproofing prevents future issues

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Fall inspection of potential water entry points
- Crack sealing before winter using cold-weather materials
- Interior waterproofing systems installed before ice dam season
- Drainage improvements completed in fall

### üö∞ Frozen Pipe Catastrophes

**Winter Pipe Risks:**
- Foundation pipes freeze and burst
- Service lines entering basement freeze
- Sump pump discharge lines freeze and back up
- Water meter connections freeze and crack
- Basement laundry connections burst

**Emergency Response Protocol:**
1. **Immediate** - Shut off water, call us immediately
2. **30-60 minutes** - Heated extraction trucks arrive
3. **First hour** - Water removal, pipe assessment
4. **Ongoing** - Repairs, drying, prevention planning

**Specialized Winter Equipment:**
- Heated water extraction trucks
- Steam thawing equipment for frozen pipes
- Cold-weather emergency pumps
- Freeze-resistant backup systems
- Heated workspace capabilities

### üå®Ô∏è Freeze-Thaw Foundation Damage

**The Destructive Cycle:**
Toronto's frequent freeze-thaw cycles are devastating to concrete foundations. Water enters hairline cracks, freezes and expands with 30,000 PSI of pressure, then thaws and allows deeper water penetration. Each cycle worsens existing damage.

**Winter Crack Emergency Service:**
- Heated injection systems work to -25¬∞C
- Winter-grade polyurethane formulations
- Emergency crack stabilization
- Interior access prevents weather delays
- Same-day service even in blizzards

**Cold Weather Foundation Repair:**
- No excavation required in winter
- Heated workspace tents when needed
- Materials specifically rated for cold application
- Interior application possible for most repairs
- Warranty coverage identical to summer work

Our winter services include interior waterproofing systems installed year-round, heated crack injection (works to -25¬∞C), emergency flood response with freeze-resistant equipment, winter-grade sealants and membranes, and heated workspace tents for exterior work when needed."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Winter creates unique risks other seasons don't have: frozen pipes can burst and flood basements instantly, ice dams force water into foundations from above, freeze-thaw cycles expand existing cracks rapidly, frozen drains cause sewage backups, and snow loads increase foundation pressure. Standard waterproofing materials and equipment fail in cold weather, requiring specialized winter-grade solutions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer", 
        "text": "Winter waterproofing costs similar to regular season work: Emergency winter service: $500-$2,000, Winter crack injection: $400-$1,200 per crack, Interior winterization: $3,000-$8,000, Complete winter system: $5,000-$12,000. No winter surcharges - we believe year-round protection shouldn't cost extra."

Our winter emergency response is available 24/7 including holidays, with heated emergency vehicles ready, 1-2 hour response in Toronto, specialized cold-weather equipment, and direct insurance billing available. We maintain the GTA's only dedicated winter waterproofing emergency service."
