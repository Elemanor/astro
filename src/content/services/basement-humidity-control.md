# Basement Humidity Control in Toronto

Stop living with a damp, musty basement. Our comprehensive humidity control solutions create dry, healthy living spaces by addressing moisture at its source.

## Understanding Basement Humidity

### Ideal Humidity Levels
- **Target Range**: 30-50% relative humidity
- **Summer Challenge**: Toronto averages 70-80%

- **Health Threshold**: Above 60% promotes mold growth

### Toronto-Specific Challenges
- High water tables
- Clay soil moisture retention
- Lake Ontario proximity
- Seasonal humidity swings
- Older home ventilation

## Signs You Need Humidity Control

### Visual Indicators
- Condensation on windows/pipes
- Efflorescence (white powder)
- Peeling paint or wallpaper
- Visible mold or mildew
- Warped wood or flooring

### Sensory Signs
- Musty, earthy odors
- Clammy, damp feeling
- Allergies worsen in basement
- Clothes feel damp
- Difficulty breathing

### Structural Warnings
- Rotting wood structures
- Rusting metal components
- Crumbling concrete
- Insulation deterioration
- Foundation damage

## Health Impacts of High Humidity

### Immediate Effects
