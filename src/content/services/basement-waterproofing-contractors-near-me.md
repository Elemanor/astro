faq:
  - question: How do I find qualified basement waterproofing contractors near me?
    answer: >-
      Look for contractors with 10+ years specialized waterproofing experience,
      proper licensing (Ontario contractor license, WSIB coverage),
      comprehensive liability insurance, Better Business Bureau accreditation,
      local office address, and verifiable neighborhood references. Always get
      multiple quotes and verify credentials.
  - question: What credentials should basement waterproofing contractors have?
    answer: >-
      Essential credentials include Ontario contractor licensing, WSIB coverage,
      $2M+ liability insurance, Better Business Bureau membership, manufacturer
      certifications for waterproofing products, and specialized waterproofing
      equipment. Verify all credentials before hiring.
  - question: How do I avoid basement waterproofing contractor scams?
    answer: >-
      Avoid door-to-door sales, full upfront payment demands, cash-only
      transactions, significantly low pricing, contractors without local
      addresses, and high-pressure sales tactics. Always verify licensing,
      insurance, and get written contracts with clear warranty terms.
  - question: What should I ask basement waterproofing contractors?
    answer: >-
      Ask about licensing and insurance, request local references, inquire about
      warranty terms, ask about emergency response availability, request
      detailed written estimates, verify specialized equipment ownership, and
      confirm local office location for ongoing support.
  - question: How much should basement waterproofing contractors charge?
    answer: >-
      Toronto basement waterproofing ranges $3,500-$8,500 for interior systems,
      $4,500-$12,000 for exterior systems. Pricing varies by foundation
      complexity, access challenges, and soil conditions. Be wary of quotes
      significantly above or below market rates.
  - question: Do basement waterproofing contractors need permits?
    answer: >-
      Exterior waterproofing typically requires building permits in Toronto
      municipalities. Interior systems may need electrical permits for sump pump
      connections. Professional contractors handle all permit applications,
      inspections, and municipal compliance requirements.
  - question: What warranty should basement waterproofing contractors provide?
    answer: >-
      Reputable contractors offer minimum 25-year labor warranties and lifetime
      material warranties. Look for transferable warranties, annual inspection
      inclusion, emergency response coverage, and written warranty terms. Avoid
      contractors offering minimal or verbal warranties only.
  - question: How quickly can basement waterproofing contractors respond?
    answer: >-
      Local Toronto contractors typically offer same-day quotes for Toronto
      Central, North York, Scarborough, and Etobicoke. Mississauga and outer
      areas usually receive next-day quotes. Emergency flooding requires
      immediate 24/7 response capability.
  - question: >-
      What's the difference between local and national waterproofing
      contractors?
    answer: >-
      Local contractors offer faster response, better Toronto soil knowledge,
      lower costs (no franchise fees), established community reputation, ongoing
      local support, and accountability. National chains often have longer
      scheduling, higher costs, and limited local expertise.
  - question: Can basement waterproofing contractors work in winter?
    answer: >-
      Interior waterproofing can be performed year-round regardless of weather.
      Exterior waterproofing is weather-dependent but experienced contractors
      work through winter using heated enclosures and specialized cold-weather
      techniques for emergency repairs.
