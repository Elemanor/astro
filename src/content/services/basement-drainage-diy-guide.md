      ### Choosing the Right Pipe for Your Application

      **1. PVC Perforated Pipe (Most Common)**
      - **Sizes**: 4" standard, 6" for high volume
      - **Perforations**: Two rows of holes
      - **Installation**: Holes face DOWN (not up!)
      - **Uses**: Foundation drainage, French drains
      - **Lifespan**: 50+ years

      **2. Corrugated Flexible Pipe (Big Box Store Special)**
      - **Pros**: Easy to install, cheap
      - **Cons**: Crushes easily, clogs, not code
      - **Verdict**: NEVER use for permanent drainage
      - **Exception**: Temporary surface water only

      **3. PVC Solid Pipe**
      - **Uses**: Discharge lines, under slabs
      - **Sizes**: 3" minimum for drainage
      - **Benefits**: Smooth interior, best flow
      - **Required**: For all non-perforated sections

      **4. ABS (Black) Pipe**
      - **Uses**: Interior plumbing drainage
      - **Note**: Different glue than PVC
      - **Code**: Approved for sanitary only
      - **Cannot**: Mix with white PVC

      **5. Weeping Tile (Clay - Historic)**
      - **Status**: No longer installed
      - **Found**: Older homes
      - **Issues**: Breaks, clogs, roots
      - **Replace**: With modern PVC
  - title: "Proper Glue and Connections"
    content: |
      ### The Right Way to Join Pipes

      **PVC Primer and Cement**
      - **Primer**: Purple, required by code
      - **Cement**: Medium-bodied for 4" pipe
      - **Temperature**: Not below 5°C
      - **Cure Time**: 2 hours before pressure

      **Proper Gluing Technique:**
      1. **Cut Square**: Use proper PVC cutter
      2. **Deburr**: Remove all burrs inside/out
      3. **Dry Fit**: Ensure proper fit first
      4. **Clean**: Both surfaces with cleaner
      5. **Prime**: Purple primer on both surfaces
      6. **Cement**: Apply to both surfaces
      7. **Join**: Push together with 1/4 turn
      8. **Hold**: 30 seconds minimum
      9. **Wipe**: Remove excess immediately

      **Common Mistakes:**
      - No primer (fails inspection)
      - Too much cement (blocks pipe)
      - Not holding (joint fails)
      - Wrong cement (ABS vs PVC)
      - Cold weather application

      **Mechanical Connections:**
      - Fernco couplings for repairs
      - Mission bands for transitions
      - Never underground exterior
      - Accessible locations only
      - Two clamps minimum
  - title: "Slope Calculations and Installation"
    content: |
      ### Getting the Grade Right

      **Calculating Proper Slope**

      **1% Minimum (1/8" per foot):**
      - 10-foot run = 1.25" drop
      - 20-foot run = 2.5" drop
      - 50-foot run = 6.25" drop

      **2% Recommended (1/4" per foot):**
      - 10-foot run = 2.5" drop
      - 20-foot run = 5" drop
      - 50-foot run = 12.5" drop

      **How to Establish Slope:**
      1. **Mark Start Point**: Where drain begins
      2. **Mark End Point**: Calculate drop needed
      3. **Snap Chalk Line**: Between points
      4. **Install Hangers**: Every 4 feet
      5. **Check Continuously**: With 4' level
      6. **Adjust as Needed**: Before backfilling

      **Using a Transit/Laser:**
      - Set up level reference
      - Mark pipe stations
      - Calculate drops
      - Transfer to pipe
      - Verify with level

      **Common Slope Errors:**
      - Eyeballing it (always wrong)
      - Inconsistent slope
      - Reverse slope sections
      - Too much slope (>4%)
      - Settling after backfill

      ### Ensuring Your Drainage Works

      **Planning Phase:**
      - Get proper permits
      - Call utility locates
      - Plan entire system
      - Order extra materials
      - Schedule inspections

      **Installation Phase:**
      - Never rush drainage
      - Check slope constantly
      - Test before covering
      - Document with photos
      - Keep permit on site

      **After Installation:**
      - Test thoroughly
      - Get final inspection
      - Keep documentation
      - Plan maintenance
      - Monitor performance

      **Remember:**
      - Water always wins
      - Slope is critical
      - Code exists for reasons
      - Inspections protect you
      - Quality materials matter
faq:
  - question: "What's the minimum slope required for basement drainage?"
    answer: "Ontario Building Code requires minimum 1% slope (1/8 inch per foot), but 2% (1/4 inch per foot) is recommended for better flow. Never exceed 4% slope as pipes can separate. Consistent slope throughout the entire run is critical."
  - question: "Should drainage pipe holes face up or down?"
    answer: "Holes MUST face DOWN, not up. This is the most common DIY mistake. Water enters through the gravel bed below, not from above. Holes facing up will clog immediately with sediment. Position pipes with two rows of holes at 4 and 8 o'clock."
  - question: "Can I use corrugated black pipe for basement drainage?"
    answer: "No. Corrugated flexible pipe is not code-compliant for permanent basement drainage. It crushes easily, clogs frequently, and has poor flow rates. Use only rigid PVC pipe - 4 inch perforated for drainage, solid for discharge lines."
  - question: "What type of gravel should I use around drainage pipes?"
    answer: "Use 3/4 inch (19mm) clear stone only. Never use crusher run or any gravel with fines - they'll clog your system. You need 6 inches of clear stone below the pipe and 6 inches above. This is not the place to save money."
  - question: "Do I need a permit for basement drainage work?"
    answer: "Yes, most drainage work requires a plumbing permit. This includes new floor drains, sump pit installation, and perimeter drainage systems. Permits ensure code compliance and protect you during resale. Work without permits may void insurance."
  - question: "How do I connect drainage to my sump pump?"
    answer: "Drainage pipes should enter the sump pit through properly sized holes cut 4-6 inches below the rim. Maintain slope right to the pit. Use rubber grommets to seal penetrations. Never connect drainage directly to the pump."
  - question: "What's required for inspection to pass?"
    answer: "Inspectors check: proper pipe size (4 inch minimum), consistent slope (1% minimum), purple primer on all PVC joints, approved materials, proper support, accessible cleanouts, and backwater valves where required. Test your system before inspection."
  - question: "Can I discharge my sump pump into the floor drain?"
    answer: "No, this is illegal. Sump pumps cannot discharge to sanitary sewers. They must discharge outside, 10 feet minimum from foundation, or to storm sewers where permitted. Connecting to floor drains can cause sewage backups and hefty fines."
  - question: "How deep should interior perimeter drains be installed?"
    answer: "Interior drains must be installed at or slightly below the footing bottom to capture water before it enters under the slab. This typically means 12-16 inches below basement floor level. Installing too shallow misses water."
  - question: "When is a backwater valve required?"
    answer: "Backwater valves are required for any fixture below street level or in areas prone to sewer backup. This includes most basement floor drains and plumbing fixtures. They prevent sewage from backing up into your basement during heavy rains."
