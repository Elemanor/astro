      **Important Notice**: This guide is specifically for homeowners who want
      to install their own sump pump system. If you're looking for professional
      installation services, please visit our [professional sump pump
      installation](/services/sump-pump-installation/) page instead.


      Installing a sump pump is one of the few basement waterproofing projects
      suitable for experienced DIYers. Done correctly, you'll have reliable
      flood protection. Done wrong, you'll have an expensive hole in your floor
      that doesn't work when you need it most.


      This guide provides exact specifications, code requirements, and
      step-by-step instructions for proper sump pump installation in Toronto.
      We'll cover what inspectors look for, common mistakes that cause failures,
      and when you should call professionals instead.


      Remember: A sump pump is only as good as its installation. The best pump
      fails if installed incorrectly.

      ### Choosing the Right Pump

      **Pump Capacity (GPH - Gallons Per Hour)**
      - **Light Duty (1,800-2,200 GPH)**: Minimal water, occasional use
      - **Standard (2,500-3,000 GPH)**: Average home, regular use
      - **Heavy Duty (3,500-4,000 GPH)**: High water table

      ### Where Water Goes Matters

      **Discharge Routing Options**

      **1. Through Rim Joist (Most Common)**
      - Drill 2" hole
      - Angle slightly down
      - Seal penetration
      - Insulate in winter
      - Easy maintenance

      **2. Underground Discharge**
      - Below frost line
      - Minimum 1% slope
      - Pop-up emitter
      - Cleanout access
      - More complex

      **3. Existing Drainage**
      - Connect to storm only
      - Never sanitary sewer
      - Check local codes
      - Proper connections
      - May need permit

      **Key Installation Points:**
      - Install check valve vertical
      - Union after check valve
      - Support pipe properly
      - Slope away from house
      - No low spots

      **Winter Considerations:**
      - Freeze protection critical
      - Larger pipe = less freezing
      - Alternative discharge ready
      - Heat tape if needed
      - Monitor in cold
  - title: Concrete Patching

faq:
  - question: What size sump pump do I need for my basement?
    answer: >-
      Most homes need a 1/3 HP pump (2,500-3,000 GPH). If you have high water
      volume or a deep pit, go with 1/2 HP. Calculate based on: pit size, water
      inflow rate, and discharge height. When in doubt, go larger - oversizing
      is better than undersizing.
  - question: Can I install a sump pump without breaking concrete?
    answer: >-
      No, proper installation requires breaking concrete to install a pit at
      least 18 inches wide and 30 inches deep. Surface-mounted pumps or pumps in
      buckets don't work effectively and don't meet code. The pit must be below
      floor level to collect water.
  - question: Do I need a permit to install a sump pump?
    answer: >-
      You'll need an electrical permit for the new dedicated circuit (required
      by code). Some municipalities also require a plumbing permit. Check local
      requirements - working without permits can void insurance and cause
      problems during home sales.
  - question: Where can I discharge my sump pump water?
    answer: >-
      Discharge must be at least 6 feet from your foundation, preferably 10+
      feet. You can discharge to your lawn, storm sewer (if permitted), or dry
      well. NEVER discharge to sanitary sewers - it's illegal and results in
      heavy fines.
  - question: How deep should the sump pit be?
    answer: >-
      Ontario Building Code requires minimum 30 inches deep. Deeper is better -
      36-42 inches provides more capacity and prevents short cycling. The pit
      should extend below your foundation footings to collect water before it
      enters the basement.
  - question: Can I use an extension cord for my sump pump?
    answer: >-
      No! Code requires a dedicated circuit with permanent wiring. Extension
      cords are fire hazards, can trip breakers under load, and may not provide
      proper grounding. Install a proper GFCI-protected outlet at least 4 feet
      above the floor.
  - question: Should I install a battery backup system?
    answer: >-
      Yes, especially if you have a finished basement or high water table. Power
      failures often occur during storms when you need the pump most. Battery
      backups cost $600-1,200 but can prevent thousands in flood damage.
  - question: Why does my new sump pump run every few minutes?
    answer: >-
      Short cycling usually means the pit is too small or the pump is too
      powerful. The pump should run for at least 10-15 seconds per cycle. If
      cycling is too frequent, you may need a larger pit or a pump with
      adjustable float settings.
  - question: Can I install the check valve horizontally?
    answer: >-
      No, check valves must be installed vertically to work properly. Horizontal
      installation causes premature failure and water hammer. Install the check
      valve directly above the pump in the vertical discharge pipe.
  - question: How much does DIY sump pump installation actually cost?
    answer: >-
      Total DIY cost typically runs $800-1,500: pump ($200-400), pit ($100-200),
      concrete work ($100), discharge piping ($100-200), electrical supplies
      ($200-300), tool rental ($100-200). Professional installation costs
      $1,500-3,000, making DIY savings $700-1,500.
