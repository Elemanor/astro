      That wall between your kitchen and living room doesn't have to stay.
      Modern beam technology allows removal of load bearing walls while
      maintaining - even improving - structural integrity. But this isn't
      weekend demolition work - it's precision structural engineering.


      We've removed hundreds of load bearing walls throughout Toronto homes.
      From Victorian row houses to suburban bungalows, every project requires
      specific engineering and careful execution. Done wrong, your house
      literally falls down. Done right, you get the open concept home you've
      always wanted.


      Our load bearing wall removal services include:

      - Complete structural assessment

      - Professional engineering and drawings

      - Beam sizing and specification

      - Temporary support installation

      - Safe wall removal

      - Steel or engineered beam installation

      - Post and footing requirements

      - Finishing to hide structural elements

      - Permit handling throughout


      Every project is engineered for your specific loads, not generic
      solutions.
  - title: Is Your Wall Load Bearing?
    content: >
      **Critical Determination Before Any Work**


      Not all walls carry loads, but assuming wrong is catastrophic. Load
      bearing walls typically:

      - Run perpendicular to floor joists

      - Sit under a wall on floor above

      - Support the center of the house

      - Carry roof loads

      - Show in original blueprints


      **Professional Assessment Includes:**

      - Examining floor/ceiling structure

      - Checking what's above the wall

      - Reviewing load paths

      - Identifying beam pockets

      - Calculating actual loads

      - Determining removal feasibility


      **Common Mistakes People Make:**

      - Assuming exterior walls carry all loads

      - Thinking parallel walls aren't structural

      - Ignoring point loads from above

      - Missing hidden beams in walls

      - Underestimating load requirements


      We've seen DIY disasters where "non-structural" walls held up entire
      floors. Professional assessment prevents catastrophe.
  - title: The Engineering Process
    content: |
      **Every Beam is Calculated, Not Guessed**

      **Load Calculation**
      Engineers determine exactly what your wall supports:
      - Dead loads (structure weight)
      - Live loads (people, furniture)
      - Snow loads from roof
      - Point loads from posts above
      - Lateral loads if applicable
      - Safety factors required by code

      **Beam Selection**
      Based on loads and span, we specify:
      - Steel beams (W-sections, HSS)
      - Engineered lumber (LVL, PSL)
      - Built-up beams
      - Flitch plates (steel + wood)
      - Appropriate size for deflection limits
      - Connection requirements

      **Support Design**
      Beams need proper support:
      - Post specifications
      - Footing requirements in basement
      - Bearing plate sizes
      - Connection hardware
      - Load path to foundation

      **Deflection Control**
      Proper sizing prevents:
      - Bouncy floors
      - Cracked ceilings
      - Door operation problems
      - Visible sagging
      - Future structural issues

      Engineering ensures your open space works beautifully for decades.
  - title: Types of Beam Installations
    content: |
      **Steel Beams**
      Most common for significant loads:
      - W-shaped sections standard
      - Incredible strength-to-size ratio
      - Spans up to 30+ feet possible
      - Fire-resistant options available
      - Can be hidden in ceiling
      - Lasts forever

      Steel works when you need:
      - Maximum strength
      - Minimal depth
      - Long spans
      - Heavy loads
      - Flush ceilings

      **Engineered Wood Beams**
      Modern wood products offer advantages:
      - LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber)
      - PSL (Parallel Strand Lumber)
      - Easier to work with than steel
      - Can be notched/drilled carefully
      - Good for moderate spans
      - More economical than steel

      **Decorative Options**
      Some clients want beams visible:
      - Reclaimed wood wrapping
      - Box beam construction
      - Faux wood covers
      - Painted steel features
      - Architectural elements

      **Flush Beam Installation**
      Hiding beams completely:
      - Recessed into ceiling joists
      - Requires more depth
      - Clean sight lines
      - More complex installation
      - Higher cost but invisible

      We recommend based on your loads, budget, and aesthetic preferences.
  - title: The Removal Process
    content: >
      **Week 1: Assessment and Permitting**

      - Structural engineer visit

      - Load calculations completed

      - Beam specifications determined

      - Permit drawings prepared

      - Permit application submitted

      - Materials ordered


      **Days 2-3: Installation**

      - Day 1: Install temporary support walls, protect surfaces, begin wall
      removal

      - Day 2: Complete removal, install beam and posts, secure connections

      - Day 3: Pour new footings if required (basement), remove temporary
      supports

      - Rough inspection scheduled


      **Week 2-3: Finishing**

      - Frame around beam if hidden

      - Mechanical systems relocated

      - Patch and finish surfaces

      - Paint/texture to match

      - Final inspection

      - Complete cleanup


      Most projects complete within 2-3 days of actual work, though permits and
      finishing extend the total timeline.
  - title: Temporary Support Systems
    content: >
      **Your House Stays Standing During Work**


      Before removing any load bearing wall, temporary supports carry loads:


      **Support Wall Construction**

      - Built on both sides of removal area

      - Engineered for actual loads

      - Properly shimmed tight

      - Load transferred safely

      - Remains until beam secured


      **Critical Safety Elements**

      - Never rely on single supports

      - Account for all loads

      - Monitor for movement

      - Professional installation only

      - Insurance requires proper support


      **Living During Construction**

      - Actual removal takes just 2-3 days

      - Temporary walls up for less than 48 hours

      - Most disruption in single weekend

      - Evening cleanup each day

      - Minimal lifestyle impact


      The speed of our installation minimizes disruption. Unlike contractors who
      drag out projects, we complete the structural work fast - it's the permits
      before and finishing after that extend timelines.
  - title: Hidden Considerations

faq:
  - question: How do I know if my wall is load bearing?
    answer: >-
      Load bearing walls typically run perpendicular to floor joists, sit under
      walls on the floor above, or support the center of the house. However,
      only professional assessment can definitively determine if a wall is
      structural. We provide thorough evaluations before any work begins.
  - question: How long does load bearing wall removal take?
    answer: >-
      The actual structural work typically takes 2-3 days. However, the complete
      project timeline is 2-4 weeks including engineering, permits, and
      finishing work. Most disruption occurs during the 2-3 day installation
      period.
  - question: Do I need a permit to remove a load bearing wall?
    answer: >-
      Yes, removing any load bearing wall requires a building permit in Toronto.
      This includes engineered drawings and structural calculations. We handle
      the entire permit process including applications and inspections.
  - question: Can I live in my home during the work?
    answer: >-
      Yes, most clients stay in their homes. The actual removal and beam
      installation takes just 2-3 days with temporary supports in place. We
      maintain safe conditions and clean up daily to minimize disruption.
  - question: What's the difference between steel and wood beams?
    answer: >-
      Steel beams offer maximum strength with minimal size, ideal for long spans
      and flush ceilings. Engineered wood beams are more economical for moderate
      spans and easier to work with. We recommend based on your specific loads
      and preferences.
  - question: How much does it cost to remove a load bearing wall?
    answer: >-
      Basic 10-12 foot removals typically cost $5,000-10,000 including
      engineering, permits, beam, and installation. Longer spans or complex
      projects range $10,500-18,500. Additional costs may include footings,
      mechanical rerouting, and finishing.
  - question: Will removing a wall damage my home?
    answer: >-
      When done properly with engineering and temporary supports, wall removal
      doesn't damage your home. Poor execution can cause cracks, sagging, and
      structural failure. Professional installation ensures safety and prevents
      problems.
  - question: Can any load bearing wall be removed?
    answer: >-
      Most load bearing walls can be removed with proper beam installation.
      However, some situations make removal impractical or extremely expensive.
      Our engineers assess feasibility during consultation.
  - question: What about electrical and plumbing in the wall?
    answer: >-
      We coordinate with licensed trades to relocate any utilities in the wall.
      This includes electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, HVAC ducts, and gas
      lines. Proper permits cover all work.
  - question: Do I need posts with the beam?
    answer: >-
      Yes, beams require proper support at each end, typically with posts that
      transfer loads to footings below. We strategically place posts to minimize
      visual impact while ensuring structural integrity.
