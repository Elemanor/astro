faq:
  - question: What is piling in foundation construction?
    answer: >-
      Piling involves installing deep foundation elements (piles) that transfer
      building loads to stable soil layers or bedrock below weak surface soils.
      Common piling types include driven piles (steel or concrete hammered into
      ground), drilled piles (augered holes filled with concrete), mini piles
      (small diameter for limited access), and helical piles (screwed into
      ground). Piling is essential when surface soils cannot support structure
      loads.
  - question: When is piling required for foundations?
    answer: >-
      Piling is required when: surface soils are weak or compressible, building
      loads exceed soil bearing capacity, high water tables affect stability,
      adjacent excavations threaten foundations, or significant settlement must
      be prevented. In Toronto, piling is common near ravines, former
      lakes/marshes, and for high-rise construction. Many underpinning projects
      use mini piles for added support.
  - question: How much does piling cost in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Piling costs in Toronto vary by type and depth. Mini piles for residential
      underpinning: $15,000-30,000 per project. Helical piles: $2,000-4,000 per
      pile. Driven piles: $5,000-10,000 per pile. Drilled caissons:
      $10,000-25,000 each. Factors affecting cost include depth to bedrock,
      access limitations, pile diameter, and number required. Most residential
      projects need 8-20 piles.
  - question: What's the difference between piling and underpinning?
    answer: >-
      While both strengthen foundations, piling and underpinning work
      differently. Underpinning extends existing foundations deeper through
      excavation and concrete. Piling installs separate deep foundation elements
      that bypass poor soil entirely. Piling often supplements underpinning in
      challenging conditions, providing additional support where traditional
      underpinning alone isn't sufficient.

    content: >
      When surface soils can't support your structure, piling provides the deep
      foundation solution you need. Our specialized piling services transfer
      building loads through weak soils to stable bearing strata or bedrock
      below. Whether you're dealing with settlement issues, planning new
      construction, or need underpinning support, professional piling ensures
      long-term stability.


      Toronto's varied geology creates unique foundation challenges. From soft
      clay deposits to high water tables to fill materials from historical
      development, many sites require piling for safe construction. Our
      experience with local soil conditions ensures we select the right piling
      system for your specific needs.


      **Why Choose Professional Piling:**

      - Bypasses all problematic surface soils

      - Reaches bedrock or stable bearing layers

      - Minimal vibration compared to traditional methods

      - Works in limited access situations

      - Provides precise load capacity

      - Permanent solution for difficult sites
  - title: Types of Piling Systems We Install
    content: >
      ### Mini Piles (Micropiles)


      **Ideal for Underpinning and Tight Spaces**


      Mini piles are small-diameter (5-12 inch) piles perfect for residential
      underpinning projects. These versatile piles work in limited access areas
      where larger equipment cannot fit.


      **Features:**

      - High-strength steel casing

      - Grouted for soil bonding

      - Minimal vibration installation

      - Works through existing foundations

      - Capacity: 25-200 tons per pile


      **Applications:**

      - Basement underpinning support

      - Foundation stabilization

      - Seismic retrofitting

      - Historic building preservation

      - Emergency stabilization


      ### Helical Piles (Screw Piles)


      **Fast Installation with Immediate Loading**


      Helical piles feature steel shafts with helical plates that are literally
      screwed into the ground. Installation torque correlates directly to
      capacity, ensuring quality control.


      **Advantages:**

      - No concrete curing time

      - Minimal site disturbance

      - All-weather installation

      - Removable if needed

      - Predictable capacity


      **Best For:**

      - Temporary structures

      - Boardwalks and decks

      - Light commercial buildings

      - Foundation repairs

      - Solar panel arrays


      ### Driven Piles


      **High Capacity for Major Projects**


      Traditional driven piles use impact hammers to advance steel or precast
      concrete piles to refusal. While noisy, they provide excellent capacity
      verification through driving resistance.


      **Types Available:**

      - Steel H-piles

      - Steel pipe piles

      - Precast concrete

      - Timber (rare today)

      - Composite materials


      **Typical Uses:**

      - Commercial buildings

      - Bridge foundations

      - Marine structures

      - Industrial facilities

      - High-rise construction


      ### Drilled Piles (Caissons)


      **Large Diameter Deep Foundations**


      Drilled piles involve augering large holes and filling with reinforced
      concrete. These provide maximum capacity for major structures.


      **Specifications:**

      - Diameters: 24-96 inches

      - Depths: Up to 100+ feet

      - Reinforced concrete design

      - Rock socket capability

      - Extremely high capacity


      **Applications:**

      - High-rise buildings

      - Bridge piers

      ### When Underpinning Needs Piling Support


      Traditional underpinning sometimes isn't enough. Piling becomes necessary
      when:

      - Bedrock is too deep for conventional underpinning

      - Soil conditions are extremely poor

      - Groundwater makes excavation dangerous

      - Adjacent structures limit excavation

      - Extra capacity is required


      ### Integrated Underpinning-Piling Systems


      **Combined Approach Benefits:**

      - Piles handle primary loads

      - Underpinning provides lateral support

      - Reduced excavation requirements

      - Faster installation

      - Enhanced safety factors


      **Typical Configuration:**

      - Mini piles at 6-8 foot centers

      - Underpinning between piles

      - Grade beam connections

      - Load transfer mechanisms

      - Integrated waterproofing


      ### Cost-Benefit Analysis


      While adding piling to underpinning increases initial costs by 30-50%,
      benefits include:

      - Eliminates settlement risk

      - Reduces excavation depth

      - Shortens project timeline

      - Provides extra capacity

      - Ensures long-term stability
