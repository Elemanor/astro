# French Drain Systems - Professional Installation in Toronto

**Eliminate basement water problems with Toronto's most trusted drainage experts**

A properly installed French drain system is your foundation's first line of defense against water damage. At DrySpace, we've perfected French drain installation through 25+ years of protecting Toronto homes from water infiltration.

## What is a French Drain System?

A French drain is a gravel-filled trench containing a perforated pipe that redirects surface and groundwater away from your foundation. This time-tested solution has protected homes for over 150 years and remains one of the most effective drainage methods available.

### How French Drains Work

1. **Water Collection**: Perforated pipes collect water from surrounding soil
2. **Filtration**: Gravel and fabric prevent soil from clogging the system
3. **Transportation**: Gravity moves water through the pipe network
4. **Discharge**: Water is directed to safe drainage areas away from your home

## Why Toronto Homes Need French Drains

### Local Water Challenges

Toronto's unique conditions make French drains essential:

- **Clay Soil**: Our heavy clay doesn't absorb water well, creating pooling
- **Spring Thaw**: Rapid snowmelt overwhelms natural drainage
- **Urban Density**: Limited green space reduces natural water absorption
- **Aging Infrastructure**: Overburdened storm sewers need supplementation
- **Climate Change**: Increasing rainfall intensity requires better drainage

### Signs You Need a French Drain

- Water pooling around foundation after rain
- Soggy spots in your yard
- Basement dampness or flooding
- Foundation cracks from hydrostatic pressure
- Efflorescence on basement walls
- Gutters overflowing despite being clean

## Types of French Drain Systems

**Installation Process:**

2. Install perforated pipe at footer level
