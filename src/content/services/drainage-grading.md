  - title: The Science of Water Management in the GTA
    content: >
      Effective drainage in Toronto requires understanding our unique geography
      and climate. The GTA sits on a complex mix of clay soils, sand deposits
      from ancient Lake Iroquois, and varying bedrock depths. This geological
      diversity means drainage solutions must be customized for each property.
      Our region receives an average of 831mm of precipitation annually, but
      it's the intensity that matters – summer storms can dump 50mm in an hour,
      while spring snowmelt can release months of accumulated water in days.


      Modern Toronto faces additional drainage challenges from increased
      urbanization. As more land is paved, natural water absorption decreases
      dramatically. A typical suburban lot that once absorbed 90% of rainfall
      may now shed 60% as runoff after development. This increased water volume,
      combined with aging municipal storm systems, puts tremendous pressure on
      individual property drainage. Professional grading and drainage design
      must account for not just your property, but the entire neighborhood's
      water flow patterns.
  - title: ROI and Property Protection Value
    content: >
      Proper drainage is the most cost-effective foundation protection
      available. Industry data shows that every dollar spent on preventive
      drainage saves $8-10 in water damage repairs. A comprehensive drainage
      system costing $5,000-$15,000 prevents foundation repairs averaging
      $25,000, basement flooding cleanup at $10,000 per incident, and landscape
      replacement costs of $5,000-$20,000. Toronto insurance companies report
      that homes with professional drainage systems file 75% fewer water damage
      claims.


      Beyond damage prevention, quality drainage adds immediate property value.
      Toronto real estate appraisers consistently note that proper grading and
      visible drainage improvements can add 2-5% to home value. For a typical
      $1.2 million Toronto home, that's $24,000-$60,000 in equity. More
      importantly, homes with drainage issues often sit on the market 45-60 days
      longer than comparable properties, and sell for 5-10% below asking price.
      Our drainage solutions come with transferable warranties that become
      selling features during real estate transactions.
  - title: Integrated Drainage System Design
    content: >
      Our drainage solutions begin with comprehensive water flow analysis using
      topographical surveying and digital modeling. We map every water source
      affecting your property: roof runoff (calculating exact volumes from roof
      area), surface flow from neighboring properties, groundwater levels, and
      municipal storm sewer capacity. This data drives engineered solutions that
      handle both average conditions and extreme weather events.


      Installation follows strict standards exceeding Ontario Building Code
      requirements. French drains use 3/4" clear stone wrapped in non-woven
      geotextile fabric, with perforated pipe sloped at minimum 1% grade. Catch
      basins are sized using rational method calculations to handle 100-year
      storm events. Downspout extensions run minimum 10 feet from foundations,
      often connecting to underground systems that daylight to safe discharge
      points. Every system includes cleanouts for maintenance access and
      overflow provisions for extreme events. We coordinate with landscapers to
      ensure drainage improvements enhance rather than detract from your
      property's aesthetics.
faq:
  - question: How do I know if I have drainage problems?
    answer: >-
      Common signs include water pooling near your foundation after rain,
      basement dampness or flooding, soggy areas in your lawn that never dry
      out, erosion patterns or soil washout, and ice buildup against your home
      in winter. Less obvious indicators include cracks in your foundation,
      doors and windows that stick seasonally, efflorescence (white powder) on
      basement walls, and increased insect activity around your foundation. If
      you notice water within 6 feet of your home 24 hours after rain, you have
      a drainage problem. Our free assessment uses moisture meters and level
      measurements to identify issues before they become expensive problems.
  - question: What's the difference between surface and subsurface drainage?
    answer: >-
      Surface drainage manages water running over the ground through grading,
      swales, and catch basins. It's visible and handles roof runoff and rain
      that falls directly on your property. Subsurface drainage deals with water
      in the soil using French drains, weeping tile, and drainage pipes below
      ground. It manages groundwater, prevents soil saturation, and relieves
      hydrostatic pressure on foundations. Most Toronto properties need both:
      surface drainage for storm management and subsurface drainage for
      groundwater control. Our integrated approach ensures both systems work
      together, with surface water directed away from subsurface systems to
      prevent overloading.
  - question: How much does professional drainage cost in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Drainage costs vary significantly based on property size, problem
      severity, and solution complexity. Basic lot regrading runs $3,000-$8,000
      for an average Toronto property. French drain installation costs $50-75
      per linear foot, with typical homes needing 100-200 feet ($5,000-$15,000).
      Complete drainage systems including regrading, French drains, catch
      basins, and downspout management range from $8,000-$25,000. Factors
      affecting cost include soil type (clay costs more than sand), access
      limitations, disposal fees for excavated soil, and restoration
      requirements. While the investment seems significant, remember that one
      basement flood can cause $20,000+ in damage.
  - question: Can I install drainage myself or do I need professionals?
    answer: >-
      While simple downspout extensions or minor grading adjustments might be
      DIY projects, professional drainage requires expertise in hydraulic
      engineering, soil science, and local codes. Improper drainage can worsen
      problems by concentrating water in new areas or overwhelming municipal
      systems. Toronto bylaws require permits for significant grading changes
      and connections to storm sewers. Our licensed installers ensure proper
      pipe sizing, correct slope calculations, appropriate materials for soil
      conditions, and legal compliance. We also provide warranties and handle
      utility locates to prevent dangerous strikes. The cost difference between
      DIY and professional installation is often offset by avoiding mistakes
      that require expensive corrections.
