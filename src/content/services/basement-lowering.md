    content: >
      Basement lowering transforms unusable crawlspaces and low-ceiling
      basements into valuable living areas. If you're tired of ducking under
      ducts or can't legally finish your basement, lowering the floor creates
      the height you need for modern living.


      Toronto homes built before 1960 typically have 6-foot basement ceilings -
      fine for storage, frustrating for living. Basement lowering gives you:

      - 8-9 foot ceiling heights

      - Legal basement apartment potential  

      - Comfortable living spaces

      - Significant property value increase

      - Double your usable square footage


      We specialize in basement lowering through underpinning and benching,
      completing most projects in 5-6 weeks. Your house stays livable throughout
      construction.
  - title: Basement Lowering Methods Explained
    content: >
      **Underpinning (Recommended)**

      The gold standard for basement lowering:

      - Maintains full floor space wall-to-wall

      - Creates clean, vertical walls

      - Allows furniture against any wall

      - Maximum property value increase

      - Higher upfront cost, better long-term value


      Process: Excavate beneath existing foundations in sections, pour new
      deeper footings, then remove interior soil to desired depth.


      **Bench Footing (Budget Option)**

      Lower-cost alternative with compromises:

      - Creates angled "bench" along walls

      - Loses 3-4 feet around perimeter

      - 30-40% less floor space

      - Restricted furniture placement

      - Lower cost, permanent space loss


      Process: Excavate center area, create reinforced concrete bench from
      existing foundation to new floor level.


      **Which Method is Right?**

      - Choose underpinning for maximum space and value

      - Consider benching only for severe budget constraints

      - Most Toronto homeowners prefer underpinning

      - We provide honest recommendations based on your goals

faq:
  - question: How much does basement lowering cost in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Basement lowering costs $30,000-70,000 depending on method. Underpinning
      (maintaining full floor space) costs $45,000-70,000 for a typical home.
      Bench footing (losing perimeter space) costs $30,000-45,000. Price
      includes excavation, structural work, waterproofing, and new concrete
      floor.
  - question: How long does basement lowering take?
    answer: >-
      Basement lowering typically takes 5-6 weeks from start to finish. This
      includes 1 week preparation, 2-3 weeks structural work, 1 week interior
      excavation, and 1 week finishing. You can usually stay in your home
      throughout, though expect noise during work hours.
  - question: Can I lower my basement without underpinning?
    answer: >-
      Yes, bench footing is an alternative that creates an angled bench along
      walls instead of digging under foundations. It's cheaper but loses 30-40%
      of floor space. Most homeowners prefer underpinning for full space
      retention, but benching works for tight budgets.
  - question: How much height can I gain lowering my basement?
    answer: >-
      Most basement lowering projects gain 2-3 feet of height. If your current
      ceiling is 6 feet, expect 8-9 feet after lowering. The amount depends on
      soil conditions, existing foundation depth, and local frost line
      requirements. We determine exact possibilities during inspection.
  - question: Is basement lowering worth it in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Yes, basement lowering typically provides 200-300% ROI in Toronto.
      Creating 1,000 sq ft of legal living space worth $200-400/sq ft adds
      $200,000-400,000 in value. Plus, rental income potential of
      $2,000-3,000/month provides ongoing returns.
  - question: Do I need permits for basement lowering?
    answer: >-
      Yes, basement lowering requires building permits including structural,
      plumbing, and electrical permits as applicable. You'll need engineered
      drawings and multiple inspections. We handle all permit applications and
      coordinate inspections as part of our service.
  - question: Can any basement be lowered?
    answer: >-
      Most basements can be lowered, but factors affecting feasibility include
      foundation type, soil conditions, water table depth, and neighboring
      structures. Stone or rubble foundations need special techniques. Very high
      water tables may require extensive drainage. Professional assessment
      determines your options.
  - question: Will basement lowering damage my house?
    answer: >-
      No, properly executed basement lowering is safe. The underpinning process
      maintains continuous support using engineered sequencing. Minor settlement
      (1-2mm) is normal and monitored throughout. Thousands of Toronto homes
      have been successfully lowered without damage.
  - question: What's included in basement lowering?
    answer: >-
      Complete basement lowering includes: excavation and soil removal,
      underpinning or benching, waterproofing systems, drainage installation,
      vapor barriers, new concrete floor, basic utility relocations, permits and
      inspections. Finishing work like framing and drywall is separate.
  - question: Can I create a legal basement apartment?
    answer: >-
      Yes, basement lowering is often the first step to creating legal
      apartments. You'll achieve required 6'5" ceiling height. Additional
      requirements include separate entrance, proper windows, fire separation,
      and sound insulation. We ensure structural work supports apartment
      conversion.
