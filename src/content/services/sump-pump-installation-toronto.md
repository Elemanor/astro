faq:
  - question: "How much does sump pump installation cost in Toronto?"
    answer: "Toronto sump pump installation typically costs $2,800-$5,000 depending on your neighborhood and specific needs. Downtown properties with access challenges cost more ($3,500-$5,000), while standard installations in North York or Scarborough range from $2,800-$4,000. This includes the pump, pit, installation, discharge setup, and warranty."
  - question: "Do I need a battery backup sump pump in Toronto?"
    answer: "Yes! Toronto experiences frequent power outages during severe storms - exactly when you need your sump pump most. Battery backup systems ($800-$1,500 additional) provide 4-8 hours of pumping during outages. Given Toronto's extreme weather events, we consider battery backup essential, not optional."
  - question: "How long does sump pump installation take?"
    answer: "Most Toronto installations complete in 1-2 days. Day 1: excavation, pit installation, and pump mounting. Day 2: electrical connections, discharge routing, and testing. Complex installations with interior drainage may take 2-3 days. We offer weekend installation for minimal disruption."
  - question: "What size sump pump do I need for my Toronto home?"
    answer: "Pump sizing depends on your water volume, not home size. Toronto's high water table areas (Beaches, Etobicoke Lakeshore) typically need ½-¾ HP pumps. Standard installations use ⅓-½ HP. We calculate exact requirements during our free assessment, then add 20% capacity for extreme weather events."
  - question: "How often should Toronto sump pumps be replaced?"
    answer: "Quality sump pumps last 7-10 years with proper maintenance. Toronto's hard water and high cycling during spring reduce lifespan. Warning signs: frequent cycling, unusual noises, visible rust, or age over 7 years. We offer preventive replacement to avoid emergency failures."
  - question: "Can you install sump pumps in finished basements?"
    answer: "Yes! We specialize in minimally invasive installation for finished basements. We protect flooring, minimize dust, and can often install through small access points. Many Toronto homeowners upgrade to sump pumps after finishing their basements for added protection."
  - question: "What permits are needed for sump pump installation in Toronto?"
    answer: "Sump pump installation typically requires a building permit and electrical permit from the City of Toronto. Discharge connections may need additional approvals. We handle all permit applications and inspections as part of our service, ensuring full compliance with Toronto bylaws."
  - question: "Do you offer emergency sump pump replacement in Toronto?"
    answer: "Yes! We provide 24/7 emergency sump pump replacement throughout Toronto and the GTA. If your pump fails during a storm, we can typically arrive within 2-4 hours. We stock all major pump brands and sizes for immediate replacement. Emergency service starts at $500 plus parts."

# Sump Pump Installation Toronto - Professional Service from $2,800

**Toronto's most trusted sump pump contractors - 3,500+ installations since 1999**

When Toronto's extreme weather strikes, your sump pump is all that stands between a dry basement and catastrophic flooding. Don't trust this critical protection to anyone - choose the contractors Toronto homeowners have relied on for over 25 years.

## Why Toronto Homes Need Professional Sump Pump Installation

### Toronto's Water Challenges Demand Expert Solutions

**Rising Water Tables**: Many Toronto neighborhoods, especially near Lake Ontario and our ravines, have water tables just 3-6 feet below ground. During spring thaw or heavy rains, this groundwater exerts tremendous pressure on your foundation.

**Extreme Weather Events**: Toronto now experiences:
- 50mm+ rainfall in single storms
- Rapid spring snowmelt causing widespread flooding  
- More frequent 100-year storms
- Power outages during severe weather

**Aging Infrastructure**: Toronto's storm sewers, designed decades ago, can't handle modern rainfall intensity. When city systems overflow, your sump pump becomes your only defense.
