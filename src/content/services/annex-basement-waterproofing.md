  - title: The Annex's Unique Heritage Challenges
    content: >
      The Annex's Victorian and Edwardian homes represent some of Toronto's
      finest architectural heritage. These 100+ year old properties require
      specialized waterproofing approaches that respect historical integrity
      while providing modern protection.


      Distinctive Annex waterproofing challenges:

      - Stone and rubble foundations from the 1880s-1910s

      - Limited foundation depths (4-5 feet typical)

      - Heritage designation restrictions

      - Shared walls in semi-detached homes

      - High property values demanding perfect execution


      Our heritage-trained team has protected hundreds of Annex homes, from
      grand Victorians on Admiral Road to charming workers' cottages near
      Bathurst. We understand both the technical and cultural importance of
      preserving these properties.

faq:
  - question: Can you waterproof without damaging heritage features?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we specialize in heritage properties. Our interior waterproofing
      systems protect foundations without affecting exterior appearance. When
      exterior work is needed, we use reversible methods that preserve
      historical materials and details.
  - question: Do stone foundations need different waterproofing?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely. Stone foundations require breathable solutions that allow
      moisture vapor to escape while preventing liquid water entry. We use
      specialized mortars, appropriate sealers, and systems designed
      specifically for historical masonry.
  - question: What about heritage permit requirements?
    answer: >-
      We handle all heritage permit applications for Annex properties. Our team
      knows the Heritage Preservation Services requirements and has established
      relationships with heritage planners for smooth approvals.
  - question: Is underpinning possible in heritage homes?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we regularly underpin Annex homes to create usable basements. Our
      hand-excavation methods and engineered support systems protect historical
      structures while achieving modern ceiling heights. All work meets heritage
      standards.
  - question: How do you handle shared walls in semi-detached homes?
    answer: >-
      Party wall agreements are essential. We coordinate with neighbors, arrange
      engineering inspections, and often implement joint solutions that benefit
      both properties. Our experience with Annex semis ensures smooth projects.
  - question: What's the cost for heritage home waterproofing?
    answer: >-
      Costs vary based on foundation type and solution chosen. Interior systems
      typically range from $5,000-12,000. Underpinning projects start around
      $40,000. We provide detailed quotes after inspection and offer financing.
  - question: Can waterproofing increase my Annex home's value?
    answer: >-
      Significantly. Dry, usable basements add substantial value in The Annex.
      Proper waterproofing enables legal basement apartments, home theatres, or
      additional living space - features buyers expect in this premium market.
  - question: How long does work take in The Annex?
    answer: >-
      Interior waterproofing typically takes 3-5 days. Underpinning projects
      require 6-8 weeks. We understand Annex owners' high standards and maintain
      clean, organized sites throughout the project duration.
  - question: Do you work with the universities and colleges nearby?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we coordinate with U of T and other institutions when working near
      campus. We understand academic schedules, exam periods, and special event
      considerations. Many professors and staff are our clients.
  - question: What warranty applies to heritage properties?
    answer: >-
      Our lifetime transferable warranty fully covers heritage homes. We
      guarantee our systems will keep your basement dry while respecting
      historical integrity. Documentation provided supports heritage tax credits
      and resale.
