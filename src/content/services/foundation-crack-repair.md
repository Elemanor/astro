      Foundation cracks are a serious concern that require immediate
      professional attention. Our certified technicians specialize in permanent
      crack repair solutions that address both the symptom and the underlying
      cause. Using advanced injection techniques and materials, we ensure your
      foundation remains structurally sound and watertight.


      Every crack tells a story about your foundation's condition. We don't just
      seal cracks - we diagnose why they occurred and implement solutions that
      prevent recurrence. Our lifetime warranty backs every repair because we're
      confident in our methods and materials.
  - title: Advanced Repair Technologies
    content: >
      **Polyurethane Injection** - Our flexible polyurethane foam expands up to
      20 times its original volume, filling every void within the crack. This
      creates a permanent, flexible seal that moves with your foundation and
      prevents water infiltration even under pressure.


      **Epoxy Injection** - For structural cracks requiring strength
      restoration, we use high-strength epoxy resins that bond concrete together
      stronger than the original material. This method is ideal for load-bearing
      walls and non-moving cracks.


      **Carbon Fiber Reinforcement** - When cracks show signs of ongoing
      movement, we apply carbon fiber strips that are 10 times stronger than
      steel. This prevents further crack widening while maintaining the wall's
      structural integrity.
faq:
  - question: How do I know if a foundation crack is serious?
    answer: >
      Serious foundation cracks typically show these characteristics:

      - Width greater than 1/4 inch

      - Horizontal orientation (indicates pressure)

      - Active water leakage

      - Visible wall movement or bowing

      - Multiple cracks appearing suddenly


      Any crack allowing water entry needs immediate attention to prevent mold
      growth and structural damage. We offer free assessments to determine
      severity.
  - question: What causes foundation cracks?
    answer: >
      Common causes in Toronto homes include:

      - **Hydrostatic pressure** from water-saturated soil

      - **Freeze-thaw cycles** expanding and contracting soil

      - **Settlement** from inadequate soil compaction

      - **Tree roots** creating pressure or removing moisture

      - **Poor drainage** directing water toward foundation


      Our repair process includes identifying and addressing the root cause to
      prevent new cracks.
  - question: How long will the repair last?
    answer: >
      Our professional repairs are designed to last the lifetime of your home:

      - Polyurethane injections remain flexible for 50+ years

      - Epoxy repairs create permanent structural bonds

      - All repairs include lifetime transferable warranty

      - Proper drainage improvements prevent recurrence


      DIY repairs typically fail within 1-2 years because they only address the
      surface.
  - question: Can I repair foundation cracks myself?
    answer: >
      While DIY kits exist, professional repair is strongly recommended because:

      - Surface patches don't penetrate the full crack depth

      - Improper materials can trap water inside walls

      - Missing the root cause leads to new cracks

      - Failed repairs often cost more to fix properly

      - No warranty protection for DIY attempts


      Our professional repairs cost less than repeated DIY attempts and include
      warranty protection.
