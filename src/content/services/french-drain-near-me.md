      installation, and regular maintenance extend lifespan. Local contractors
      provide ongoing support ensuring optimal drainage performance.
  - question: What French drain type is best for my area?
    answer: >-
      System selection depends on local conditions: clay soil areas benefit from
      enhanced aggregate, ravine lots need slope management, heritage properties
      require specialized techniques. Local experts assess your specific
      drainage situation and neighborhood conditions.
  - question: Do French drain contractors offer warranties?
    answer: >-
      Reputable local contractors offer comprehensive warranties from 25 years
      to lifetime on materials and installation. Local warranties are valuable
      because companies maintain physical presence for ongoing service. Look for
      transferable warranties and emergency support.
