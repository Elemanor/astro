faq:
  - question: "How fast can you respond to basement flooding emergencies in Toronto?"
    answer: |
      We guarantee response within 1 hour in Toronto's core areas and within 2 hours throughout the Greater Toronto Area. Our emergency dispatch system operates 24/7/365 with crews strategically positioned across the GTA.
      
      Average response times by area: Downtown Toronto (45 minutes), North York (60 minutes), Scarborough (75 minutes), Mississauga (90 minutes), Brampton/Vaughan (90-120 minutes). Emergency crews are dispatched immediately upon your call, and you'll receive real-time updates on arrival time.
      
      For active flooding situations, we can often provide telephone guidance for immediate damage control while our crew is en route.
  - question: "What should I do while waiting for emergency waterproofing service?"
    answer: |
      Priority 1: Ensure safety - never enter a flooded basement with electrical hazards present. Turn off electricity to the basement if safely possible from the main panel.
      
      Priority 2: Stop water source if possible - locate and shut off the main water valve if a pipe has burst. For external flooding, move valuables to higher ground immediately.
      
      Priority 3: Document damage - take photos/video for insurance claims before moving items. Remove important documents and electronics from water's path.
      
      Priority 4: Clear access - ensure our crew can access your basement quickly. Unlock gates, move vehicles from driveways, and have house keys ready.
      
      Our emergency dispatcher will provide specific guidance based on your situation when you call (437) 545-0067.
  - question: "How much does emergency basement waterproofing cost?"
    answer: |
      Emergency service costs vary by situation severity and time required. Typical emergency response costs: Emergency call-out fee ($200-$400), water extraction ($150-$300/hour), temporary repairs ($500-$2,500), and equipment deployment ($100-$200/hour).
      
      Most emergency calls range from $800-$3,500 for immediate stabilization. Permanent repairs are quoted separately after damage assessment. We provide upfront pricing and work directly with insurance companies for covered damages.
      
      Emergency rates apply during nights, weekends, and holidays, but immediate response prevents exponentially higher damage costs. Many homeowners find emergency service costs are fully covered by insurance when properly documented.
  - question: "Do you work with insurance companies for emergency claims?"
    answer: |
      Yes, we're approved vendors for all major insurance companies and can bill directly for covered emergency services. We provide comprehensive documentation including photos, moisture readings, cause determination, and detailed repair estimates.
      
      Our insurance services include: immediate claim reporting assistance, adjuster meeting coordination, supplement negotiation for additional damages, and restoration contractor referrals. We ensure you receive maximum coverage for your claim.
      
      Most insurance policies cover emergency water extraction and temporary repairs. Our team knows which services are typically covered and can expedite the claims process while protecting your property.
