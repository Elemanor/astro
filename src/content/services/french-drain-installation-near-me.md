faq:
  - question: How do I find reliable French drain installation near me?
    answer: >-
      Look for local contractors with 10+ years of drainage experience, proper
      licensing and insurance, verifiable neighborhood references, and
      specialized French drain equipment. Check their physical local address,
      Better Business Bureau rating, and recent local project examples. Ask
      neighbors for recommendations and verify they offer detailed written
      estimates with system specifications.
  - question: What's the cost of French drain installation in my Toronto area?
    answer: >-
      Interior French drains range $2,800-$7,000, exterior systems
      $3,800-$8,500, depending on your specific area and requirements. Downtown
      Toronto commands premium pricing due to access challenges, while suburban
      areas offer competitive rates. Ravine lots and complex topography may
      increase costs. Get multiple local quotes for accurate pricing.
  - question: How long does French drain installation take near me?
    answer: >-
      Interior French drain installation typically takes 2-3 days, exterior
      systems take 3-5 days depending on length and complexity. Local
      contractors often work faster due to nearby material suppliers and
      familiarity with local soil conditions. Weather affects exterior
      installations, while interior work proceeds year-round.
  - question: Do I need permits for French drain installation in Toronto?
    answer: >-
      Exterior French drains typically require building permits in Toronto area
      municipalities. Interior installations may need electrical permits for
      sump pump connections. Reputable local contractors handle all permit
      applications and inspections, understanding specific requirements for your
      city and maintaining relationships with local inspectors.
  - question: Can French drains be installed in winter near me?
    answer: >-
      Interior French drains can be installed year-round regardless of weather.
      Exterior installations are weather-dependent but many local contractors
      work through winter using heated enclosures and specialized techniques.
      Frozen ground may delay excavation, but emergency installations proceed
      when necessary.
  - question: How do French drains work in Toronto's clay soil?
    answer: >-
      Clay soil requires specialized French drain design with proper filter
      fabric, larger gravel, and enhanced drainage capacity. Local contractors
      use clay-specific materials and installation techniques, often including
      surface water diversion to reduce subsurface pressure. Proper design
      prevents clogging and ensures long-term performance in clay conditions.
  - question: What's the difference between local and national French drain companies?
    answer: >-
      Local companies offer faster response, better knowledge of Toronto soil
      conditions and building codes, lower costs (no travel charges),
      established community reputation, and ongoing local support. They
      understand neighborhood-specific drainage challenges, have relationships
      with local suppliers, and their reputation depends on local customer
      satisfaction.
  - question: How long do French drains last when properly installed?
    answer: >-
      Professional French drain installations last 30-50 years with proper
      maintenance. Quality materials, correct installation techniques, and
      regular maintenance extend lifespan. Local contractors provide ongoing
      support and maintenance services, ensuring optimal performance throughout
      the system's life. Annual inspections help identify issues before they
      become problems.
  - question: Can French drains solve my basement flooding problems?
    answer: >-
      French drains are highly effective for basement flooding prevention when
      properly designed for your specific conditions. Interior systems manage
      water after entry, exterior systems prevent water from reaching
      foundations. Local experts assess your situation and recommend the best
      approach for your neighborhood's conditions and your property's needs.
  - question: Do French drain installations come with warranties?
    answer: >-
      Reputable local contractors offer comprehensive warranties from 25 years
      to lifetime on materials and installation. Local warranties are valuable
      because companies maintain physical presence for ongoing service. Look for
      transferable warranties, annual inspection inclusion, and emergency
      support. Verify warranty terms and local service capabilities.
