faq:
  - question: "What makes basement waterproofing in Toronto different from other cities?"
    answer: "Toronto's unique challenges include 122 days of annual precipitation, expansive clay soil that moves with seasons, aging infrastructure (many homes 50+ years old), extreme freeze-thaw cycles, and high water table in many neighborhoods. Our Toronto-specific solutions address these exact conditions with proven materials and techniques developed over 15+ years of local experience."
  - question: "How much does basement waterproofing cost in Toronto?"
    answer: "Toronto basement waterproofing costs vary by neighborhood and home type: Downtown/Central ($6,500-$15,000), North Toronto ($4,500-$12,000), East Toronto ($4,000-$11,000), West Toronto ($4,200-$11,500). Factors include foundation age, soil conditions, access challenges, and required permits. We provide detailed written estimates with no hidden fees."
  - question: "Can you work during Toronto winters?"
    answer: "Yes! Interior waterproofing works year-round regardless of weather. Exterior waterproofing can be done in winter using heated enclosures and winter-grade materials. We provide 24/7 emergency service regardless of weather conditions, with permanent solutions scheduled for optimal conditions."
  - question: "Do you handle Toronto building permits?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We handle all permit applications with the City of Toronto, including building permits for excavation, electrical permits for sump pumps, and plumbing permits for drainage. Our established relationships with Toronto building departments ensure smooth processing and faster project starts."
  - question: "How do you compare with other waterproofing companies in Toronto?"
    answer: "We offer faster Toronto response times (same-day vs 2-3 days), more focused local expertise, competitive pricing, and lifetime warranty coverage. Our Toronto-only focus means deeper neighborhood knowledge, established local relationships, and better ongoing support for Toronto homeowners."
  - question: "What Toronto neighborhoods do you serve?"
    answer: "We serve all Toronto neighborhoods including Downtown Core, Financial District, North York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, East York, Midtown, Uptown, Beaches, High Park, Junction, Leslieville, Riverdale, Cabbagetown, Rosedale, Forest Hill, Lawrence Park, and all surrounding areas with same-day service availability."
  - question: "Why choose local Toronto contractors over national companies?"
    answer: "Local Toronto contractors offer superior value: faster response times, intimate knowledge of Toronto soil/climate conditions, established relationships with local suppliers and inspectors, community accountability, no travel charges, and ongoing local presence for warranty service and support."
  - question: "How long does basement waterproofing take in Toronto?"
    answer: "Timeline varies by system type and Toronto-specific factors: Interior systems (2-3 days), Exterior systems (5-10 days weather permitting). Toronto projects often complete faster due to our local supplier relationships, material availability, and familiarity with city permit processes."
  - question: "What warranty do you provide for Toronto projects?"
    answer: "We provide comprehensive warranty coverage: Lifetime material warranty, 25-year labor warranty, transferable coverage for home sales, annual inspections included, 24/7 emergency support, and guaranteed local Toronto service throughout warranty period."
  - question: "Do you offer financing for Toronto homeowners?"
    answer: "Yes, we offer multiple financing options for Toronto residents: 0% interest for 12 months (qualified customers), extended payment plans up to 60 months, assistance with home equity line coordination, and help with insurance claim documentation and processing."

### Can you work during Toronto's harsh winters?
**Yes, we work year-round in Toronto conditions:** Interior waterproofing works regardless of Toronto weather - perfect for emergencies and finished basements. Exterior waterproofing uses heated enclosures and winter-grade materials proven in Toronto conditions. **Toronto winter advantages:** Less competition means faster scheduling, indoor work continues normally, emergency repairs proceed immediately regardless of weather.
