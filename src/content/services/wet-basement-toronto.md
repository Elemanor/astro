**Emergency Wet Basement Response: (437) 545-0067**

## Understanding Toronto's Wet Basement Crisis

### Why Toronto Basements Get Wet

Toronto's unique geography and infrastructure create perfect conditions for basement water problems:

**Natural Factors**:
- **High Water Table**: Many areas sit above underground water
- **Clay Soil**: Poor drainage leads to water accumulation
- **Ravines & Valleys**: Natural water flow toward homes
- **Lake Effect**: Proximity to Lake Ontario increases moisture

**Urban Challenges**:
- **Aging Infrastructure**: 100+ year old sewer systems
- **Combined Sewers**: Storm and sanitary overflow risks
- **Urban Density**: Reduced natural drainage areas
- **Construction Impact**: Disrupted water tables

**Climate Issues**:
- **Freeze-Thaw Cycles**: Foundation stress and cracks
- **Intense Storms**: Overwhelming drainage systems
- **Spring Thaws**: Rapid snowmelt and saturation
- **Summer Downpours**: Flash flooding events
