faq:
  - question: What makes commercial waterproofing different from residential?
    answer: >-
      Commercial waterproofing requires specialized knowledge of complex
      building systems, higher liability management, regulatory compliance, and
      minimal business disruption techniques. We work with larger scale
      projects, industrial-grade materials, and must coordinate with multiple
      stakeholders while maintaining operations.
  - question: How much does commercial waterproofing cost?
    answer: >-
      Commercial waterproofing costs vary significantly by project scope:
      preventive maintenance ($5K-25K), system upgrades ($25K-150K), complete
      protection ($150K-750K+). Factors include building size, complexity,
      access limitations, and timeline requirements. We provide detailed ROI
      analysis with every proposal.
  - question: Can you work around our business operations?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely. We specialize in minimizing business disruption through

    answer: >-
      We service all commercial property types: multi-unit buildings (100+

      structures, hospitals, schools, hotels, and institutional buildings. Each
      property type has unique requirements we address with specialized
      solutions.
  - question: How do you handle liability and insurance for commercial projects?
    answer: >-
      We carry $5M general liability, professional liability, pollution
      liability, and builder's risk coverage. We're bonded up to $2M per project
      and maintain full WSIB compliance. We work with your insurance team to
      ensure coverage coordination and claims support when needed.
  - question: What warranties do you provide for commercial work?
    answer: >-
      Commercial warranties range from 10-25 years depending on the system and
      materials used. All warranties are transferable to new owners, include
      no-deductible coverage, and feature annual inspection programs. Extended
      service agreements provide ongoing support and priority response.
  - question: Do you provide emergency commercial waterproofing services?
    answer: >-
      Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency response for commercial properties with
      2-hour response times. Our emergency services include immediate
      stabilization, temporary protection, water extraction, and rapid permanent
      repairs. We maintain emergency equipment stockpiles and multi-crew
      capabilities.
  - question: How do you handle permits and regulatory compliance?
    answer: >-
      We manage all permit acquisition, building code compliance, and regulatory
      requirements. Our team understands OBC requirements, Toronto Municipal
      Code, fire safety regulations, and accessibility standards. We coordinate
      with authorities and provide all necessary documentation.
  - question: What financing options are available for commercial projects?
    answer: >-
      We offer equipment financing (5-7 years), property improvement loans, line
      of credit options, and payment plans. Many clients also access energy
      efficiency rebates, building retrofit incentives, and insurance premium
      financing. We help identify the best financing structure for your
      situation.
  - question: How long do commercial waterproofing projects typically take?
    answer: >-
      Timeline varies by scope: minor repairs (1-3 days), system upgrades (1-4
      weeks), major renovations (2-8 weeks). We provide detailed project
      schedules with milestone tracking and coordinate with your operational
      requirements to minimize disruption. Emergency projects can often be
      expedited.
