# Ajax Basement Waterproofing Services

Protecting Ajax homes from water damage with professional basement waterproofing solutions. As Durham Region's trusted waterproofing experts, we understand the unique challenges Ajax properties face from high water tables, clay soil conditions, and proximity to Lake Ontario.

## Why Ajax Homes Need Specialized Waterproofing

### Local Environmental Challenges

**High Water Table Issues**
Ajax's proximity to Lake Ontario creates elevated groundwater levels, especially in southern neighborhoods near the waterfront. This constant hydrostatic pressure requires robust waterproofing solutions.

**Clay Soil Expansion**
The heavy clay soil common throughout Ajax expands when wet and contracts when dry, creating foundation stress and cracks that allow water infiltration.

**Severe Weather Patterns**
Durham Region experiences intense summer storms and rapid spring melts, overwhelming drainage systems and causing basement flooding.
