- **Mold growth** beginning within 24-48 hours
- **Structural damage** to foundation and framing
- **Destroyed belongings** and memories
- **Electrical hazards** threatening safety

### Toronto's Flooding Hotspots
We respond fastest to high-risk areas:
- **Downtown core** - combined sewer overflows
- **Beaches/Leslieville** - high water table
- **Black Creek area** - flash flood zone
