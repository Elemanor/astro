## Why Oakville Properties Require Specialized Weeping Tile Systems

Oakville's unique combination of challenging clay soils, extensive ravine systems, and diverse neighborhood characteristics creates complex drainage requirements that demand expertly engineered weeping tile solutions:

### Oakville's Clay Soil Composition
The town's geological foundation creates significant drainage challenges:
- **Dense Halton clay** prevalent throughout most neighborhoods
- **Poor soil permeability** prevents natural water absorption
- **Seasonal clay expansion** increases foundation pressure
- **Variable clay depth** from 6-20 feet across different areas
- **Water retention** creates persistent moisture problems

### Sixteen Mile Creek & Ravine Impact
Oakville's extensive creek and ravine network significantly affects local drainage:
- **Sixteen Mile Creek** main watershed through central Oakville
- **Fourteen Mile Creek** western boundary areas
- **Bronte Creek** eastern neighborhoods
- **Extensive ravine system** creates complex water flow patterns
- **Seasonal water table** fluctuations following creek levels

### Lake Ontario Proximity Effects
Oakville's location along Lake Ontario creates unique drainage conditions:
- **Lake effect precipitation** increases annual moisture load  
- **Fluctuating groundwater** follows lake level changes
- **Coastal clay deposits** retain moisture year-round
- **Prevailing wind patterns** drive moisture inland
- **Freeze-thaw cycles** intensify near the lakeshore
