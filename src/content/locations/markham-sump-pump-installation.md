## Markham Sump Pump FAQ

**Q: How often should pumps run in Markham?**
A: During spring/heavy rain, every 30-60 minutes is normal. If running constantly or never, there's a problem. Markham's high water table means pumps work harder here.

**Q: Do I really need battery backup?**
A: Absolutely. Most flooding happens during storms when power fails. Markham has experienced numerous power outages during critical rain events. Battery backup is essential.

**Q: How long do sump pumps last?**
A: In Markham's high-use conditions, expect 5-7 years for primary pumps. That's why we recommend backup systems and maintenance programs.

**Q: Can I install a sump pump myself?**
A: While possible, professional installation ensures proper sizing, code compliance, and warranty validity. Mistakes can void insurance coverage.

**Q: What size pump do I need?**
A: Depends on your water table, home size, and drainage. Most Markham homes need minimum 1/2 HP. We calculate exact requirements during assessment.
