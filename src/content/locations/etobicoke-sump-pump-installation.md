## Etobicoke Sump Pump FAQ

**Q: Why do Etobicoke pumps work so much harder?**
A: Lake Ontario creates an extremely high water table year-round. Etobicoke pumps can run 24/7 during wet seasons, versus a few times per month in drier areas. This requires heavy-duty systems.

**Q: Do I need special pumps near the lake?**
A: Absolutely. Lake proximity requires marine-grade components that resist corrosion and handle continuous operation. Standard pumps fail quickly in these conditions.

**Q: How important is backup power in Etobicoke?**
A: Critical. Lake storms frequently cause extended power outages when you need pumps most. Battery backup isn't optional—it's essential survival equipment.

**Q: Can smart systems predict lake-related flooding?**
A: Yes. Our systems integrate with Environment Canada lake level and weather data to provide advance warning and automatic preparation for storm events.

**Q: How often do lakefront pumps need replacement?**
A: In Etobicoke's harsh conditions, expect 3-5 years for primary pumps. That's why we recommend redundant systems and comprehensive maintenance programs.
