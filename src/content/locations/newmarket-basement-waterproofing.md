## Newmarket-Specific FAQ

**Q: How does the Holland Marsh affect my basement in Newmarket?**
A: The historic Holland Marsh was drained for agriculture, but the water table remains extremely high. This creates year-round hydrostatic pressure on foundations, especially during spring snowmelt and fall rains when agricultural drainage systems are overwhelmed.

**Q: Are heritage homes in downtown Newmarket harder to waterproof?**
A: Yes, but we specialize in heritage-sensitive solutions. Stone foundations require different techniques than modern concrete, and we work within heritage district guidelines to preserve historical integrity while providing modern protection.

**Q: What about homes near Fairy Lake?**
A: Lake proximity creates additional challenges with seasonal water level changes and increased ground saturation. We design systems that account for both lake water pressure and Holland Marsh water table fluctuations.

**Q: Can you work around septic systems in rural Newmarket?**
A: Absolutely. Rural properties often have unique drainage challenges with wells and septic systems. We coordinate with health unit requirements and design systems that work with existing infrastructure.

**Q: How quickly can you respond to flooding emergencies?**
A: We maintain emergency equipment in Newmarket and guarantee response within 30-45 minutes for downtown areas and 60-90 minutes for rural properties, 24/7/365.
