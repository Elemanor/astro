## Frequently Asked Questions - Oakville Foundation Emergencies

### Q: How quickly can you respond to a foundation leak emergency?
**A:** Our average response time across Oakville is 15-25 minutes. Old Oakville and lakefront areas often get faster service due to dedicated local crews.

### Q: Can you really seal foundation cracks permanently?
**A:** Yes. Our polyurethane injection process creates a flexible, permanent seal that moves with your foundation. We provide a lifetime transferable warranty on all crack injection repairs.

### Q: Do you service lakefront properties differently?
**A:** Absolutely. Lakefront properties face unique challenges from storm surge, high water tables, and marine environments. We use specialized materials and techniques designed for these conditions.

### Q: What should I do if my foundation is actively leaking?
**A:** Call us immediately at (437) 545-0067. While waiting, move valuables away from the leak area and avoid electrical hazards. Don't try to seal major leaks yourself - improper repairs can make problems worse.

### Q: Will foundation leak repair work void my home warranty?
**A:** Not when done professionally. We coordinate with warranty providers and use approved methods that preserve your coverage. Many warranties actually require prompt professional repair.

### Q: How much does emergency foundation leak repair cost?
**A:** Most emergency crack repairs range from $300-$1,200 depending on size and complexity. We provide upfront pricing with no emergency surcharges. Delaying repair costs much more in water damage.
