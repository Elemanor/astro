## Frequently Asked Questions About Waterproofing Contractors

### How do I choose the right waterproofing contractors in Scarborough?
Look for contractors with specific Scarborough experience, clay soil expertise, proper licensing and insurance, and warranties on their work. Our 25+ years serving Scarborough exclusively, combined with clay soil specialization, sets us apart from general contractors.

### What's the difference between interior and exterior waterproofing?
Exterior waterproofing addresses water at the source, preventing infiltration entirely. Interior systems manage water that does infiltrate. For Scarborough's clay soils, exterior solutions often provide superior long-term protection, though interior systems work well as backup or where excavation isn't feasible.

### How long does professional waterproofing last?
Quality waterproofing systems last decades with proper installation. Our exterior systems come with 25-year warranties, while interior systems include lifetime warranties. Many of our 1990s installations continue performing perfectly today.

### Will waterproofing work in Scarborough's clay soil?
Yes, but it requires specialized techniques and materials. Clay soil creates unique challenges that generic contractors often can't handle. Our clay-specific methods and 25+ years of Scarborough experience ensure permanent solutions.

### What happens if waterproofing fails?
Quality contractors stand behind their work with comprehensive warranties. We provide 25-year warranties on exterior work and lifetime warranties on interior systems, including annual inspections to ensure continued performance.

### Can you waterproof during winter?
Most waterproofing can be completed year-round. Exterior excavation may be limited during extreme weather, but interior systems and emergency repairs continue regardless of season. We adjust methods for seasonal conditions.

### Do you handle insurance claims?
Yes, we provide complete documentation for insurance claims and work directly with adjusters when appropriate. Many basement flooding situations qualify for coverage, and we help maximize your claim value.

### How do I maintain my waterproofing system?
Annual inspections, drainage cleaning, and sump pump testing maintain system effectiveness. We provide maintenance programs and reminders to protect your investment and maintain warranty coverage.
