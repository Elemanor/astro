## North York Sump Pump FAQ

**Q: How do clay soils affect sump pump performance?**
A: Clay soil significantly increases pump workload. Water doesn't absorb naturally, creating hydrostatic pressure. North York pumps typically run 50% more than sandy soil areas, requiring heavy-duty systems.

**Q: Why do North York homes need battery backup?**
A: Critical. Most flooding occurs during storms when power fails. North York has experienced multiple extended outages during severe weather. Battery backup isn't optional here—it's essential protection.

**Q: How often should pumps be serviced in clay soil?**
A: Clay conditions require more frequent maintenance. We recommend semi-annual service for North York homes due to increased sediment and mineral buildup.

**Q: Can smart pumps handle North York's challenging conditions?**
A: Absolutely. Smart monitoring is actually more valuable in challenging conditions. You'll know immediately if there are issues, and can schedule maintenance before problems develop.

**Q: What's the lifespan of pumps in North York?**
A: In clay soil conditions, expect 4-6 years for primary pumps versus 7-10 in sandy soil. That's why backup systems and maintenance programs are crucial investments.
