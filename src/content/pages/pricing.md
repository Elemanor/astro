## üèóÔ∏è Understanding When Each Service Is Needed

### Foundation Crack Repair Services
**When You Need It**: Notice hairline cracks in basement walls, water seepage through walls, or cracks that grow over time. Most common in Toronto homes 15+ years old, especially after freeze-thaw cycles.

**Our Process**: We use advanced crack injection techniques with polyurethane or epoxy depending on crack type. Active leaks get polyurethane for flexibility, while stable cracks get epoxy for structural strength.

**What Makes Us Different**: We don't just fill cracks - we address the underlying cause. Our engineers assess why the crack formed and prevent future cracking.

### Interior Waterproofing Services
**When You Need It**: Basement humidity, musty odors, efflorescence (white mineral deposits), or minor water seepage. Perfect for Toronto's clay soil conditions where exterior excavation is challenging.

**Our Process**: We install a comprehensive interior drainage system including weeping tiles, sump pump, vapor barrier, and restore concrete to look better than before.

**What Makes Us Different**: Our interior systems come with lifetime transferable warranties and work seamlessly with your home's existing structure.

### Exterior Waterproofing Services  
**When You Need It**: Major water infiltration, foundation wall deterioration, or when selling your home. Required for homes with ongoing structural issues or where interior solutions aren't sufficient.

**Our Process**: Complete excavation around affected areas, application of waterproof membrane, installation of drainage systems, and proper backfilling with clean materials.

**What Makes Us Different**: We use excavation techniques that preserve your landscaping and restore everything better than before. Our membranes are rated for 25+ years.

### Foundation Settlement Repair
**When You Need It**: Doors/windows that stick, cracks in drywall, uneven floors, or visible foundation sinking. Common in Toronto due to clay soil movement and aging infrastructure.

**Our Process**: We use helical piers, push piers, or slabjacking depending on soil conditions and foundation type. All solutions are engineered for your specific situation.

**What Makes Us Different**: Our settlement repairs come with structural engineer certification and are designed to prevent future movement.
