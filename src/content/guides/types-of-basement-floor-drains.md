# FAQ Section
faq:
  - question: "What are the main types of basement floor drains?"
    answer: "The main types of basement floor drains include: standard floor drains (4-6 inch round drains with P-traps), French drains (perimeter drainage systems), trench/channel drains (linear drains for larger areas), foundation drains (connected to weeping tile), and specialty drains like backwater valve drains. Each type serves specific drainage needs in Toronto basements."
  
  - question: "Which type of basement drain is best for my home?"
    answer: "The best type of basement floor drain depends on your specific needs. Standard floor drains work well for general water removal and washing. French drains are ideal for groundwater management. Trench drains handle surface water from garage entries. Many Toronto homes benefit from combining multiple drain types for comprehensive protection."
  
  - question: "Do all basement floor drains connect to the sewer?"
    answer: "Not all types of basement floor drains connect to the sewer. Standard floor drains typically connect to sanitary sewers. French drains and foundation drains usually connect to sump pumps or storm sewers. In Toronto, connecting foundation drainage to sanitary sewers is prohibited to prevent system overload."
  
  - question: "How do I maintain different types of basement drains?"
    answer: "Maintenance varies by drain type. Standard floor drains need regular water to maintain trap seals and occasional snaking. French drains require annual flushing and inspection. Trench drains need grate cleaning and sediment removal. All types benefit from professional inspection every 2-3 years to ensure proper function."

      Basement floor drains are your first line of defense against water accumulation, but not all drains are created equal. Different types of basement floor drains serve distinct purposes, from handling washing machine overflow to managing groundwater infiltration. Understanding these differences helps Toronto homeowners choose the right drainage solutions for their specific needs.

      Modern basements often incorporate multiple drain types working together as a comprehensive water management system. While that circular drain in your basement floor might be the most visible, it's likely just one component of a larger drainage network protecting your foundation. Let's explore each type and understand when and why you need them.

      **Why Multiple Drain Types Matter:**
      - Different water sources require different solutions
      - Code requirements vary by drain function
      - Some drains prevent sewer gases, others don't need to
      - Proper selection prevents flooding and damage
      - Each type has specific maintenance requirements

      ### The Classic Round Floor Drain

      The most common of all types of basement floor drains, standard floor drains are typically 4-6 inches in diameter with a removable grate cover. These drains serve as catch-alls for various water sources in your basement.

      **Key Features:**
      - Round or square grate design
      - Built-in P-trap to block sewer gases
      - Connected to sanitary or storm sewer
      - Primer port for trap maintenance
      - Bell housing below floor level

      **Primary Functions:**
      - Washing machine overflow protection
      - Water heater leak containment
      - Floor washing drainage
      - Emergency flood relief
      - Condensate drainage

      **Installation Requirements:**
      - Slope floor 1/4" per foot toward drain
      - Maintain 2" trap seal depth
      - Install cleanout access nearby
      - Include backwater valve if required
      - Proper venting per code

      **Common Problems:**
      - Dry traps allowing sewer gas entry
      - Clogs from debris and sediment
      - Backflow during sewer surcharge
      - Frozen traps in unheated basements
      - Root intrusion in older systems

      ### Managing Groundwater Effectively

      French drains represent a different category among types of basement floor drains, designed specifically for groundwater management rather than surface water. These systems run along the interior perimeter of your basement, collecting water before it enters the living space.

      **System Components:**
      - Perforated pipe (4" typical)
      - Filter fabric wrap
      - Drainage stone surround
      - Connection to sump pump
      - Vapor barrier option

      **How French Drains Work:**
      1. Water enters through foundation wall/floor joint
      2. Flows into gravel and perforated pipe
      3. Travels to sump pump basin
      4. Pumped away from foundation
      5. No sewer connection required

      **Installation Process:**
      - Cut channel in concrete floor
      - Excavate to footing level
      - Install pipe and stone
      - Cover with concrete
      - Connect to sump system

      **Advantages:**
      - Handles high water tables
      - Doesn't rely on municipal sewers
      - Works during power outages (with backup)
      - Reduces hydrostatic pressure
      - Can retrofit existing basements

      ### Linear Drainage Solutions

      Trench drains (also called channel drains) are linear types of basement floor drains ideal for capturing surface water across wider areas. Common in garage entrances, walkout basements, and commercial applications.

      **Design Features:**
      - Long, narrow profile (4-12" wide)
      - Removable grating system
      - Pre-sloped channel options
      - Various grate materials
      - Modular connections

      **Ideal Applications:**
      - Garage door thresholds
      - Walkout basement entries
      - Workshop areas
      - Laundry room floors
      - Commercial kitchens

      **Material Options:**
      - Polymer concrete (most common)
      - Cast iron (heavy duty)
      - Stainless steel (sanitary)
      - PVC/Plastic (economical)
      - Fiberglass (corrosion resistant)

      **Installation Considerations:**
      - Requires concrete cutting
      - Must maintain proper slope
      - Needs adequate outlet capacity
      - Consider freeze protection
      - Plan for maintenance access

      - Perforated PVC pipe
      - Continuous lengths
      - Filter sock protection
      - Smooth interior flow
      - 100+ year lifespan

      **Connection Methods:**
      - Direct to sump pump (preferred)
      - Storm sewer if permitted
      - Never to sanitary sewer
      - Gravity flow when possible
      - Pumped systems when required

      **Inspection and Access:**
      - Cleanout ports recommended
      - Camera inspection capability
      - Flushing connections
      - Monitoring wells
      - Test pumping provisions
