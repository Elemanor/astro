Winter poses the greatest threat to Toronto foundations. With temperatures ranging from -20°C to +5°C, freeze-thaw cycles create tremendous stress on foundation materials.

## Winter Foundation Threats

### Freeze-Thaw Damage
- Water expands 9% when freezing
- Concrete cracks widen with each cycle
- Frost penetration reaches 4-5 feet
- Ice lenses form in soil

### Common Winter Problems
- Frost heave lifting foundations
- Ice dams causing water backup
- Frozen sump discharge lines
- Condensation on cold walls
- Basement flooding during thaws

## Active Winter Monitoring

### Weekly Inspections
Check these areas weekly:
- Foundation walls for new cracks
- Basement humidity levels (30-50%)
- Sump pump operation
- Window wells for ice buildup
- Temperature consistency

### After Each Storm
- Clear snow from foundation (5-foot perimeter)
- Remove ice from window wells
- Check gutters aren't blocked by ice
- Ensure vents aren't covered by snow

## Critical Winter Tasks

### Snow Management
Proper snow removal prevents:
- Melt water pooling at foundation
- Excessive weight on walls
- Ice formation in window wells
- Blocked ventilation

### Temperature Control
Maintain stable temperatures:
- Basement minimum 10°C (50°F)
- Avoid rapid temperature changes
- Insulate cold spots
- Run fans to circulate air

## Emergency Situations

### Call Immediately for:
- Water entering basement
- Sudden large cracks
- Doors/windows won't close
- Visible foundation movement
- Frozen pipe concerns

**24/7 Winter Emergency: (437) 545-0067**

## Winter Damage Prevention

### Monthly Tasks
- Test sump pump with warm water
- Check dehumidifier operation
- Inspect for condensation
- Monitor crack sizes
- Clear snow after each storm

### Equipment Maintenance
- Keep backup pump ready
- Test generator monthly
- Maintain space heaters
- Stock emergency supplies
- Update emergency contacts

## Cost of Winter Damage

Typical winter-related repairs:
- Frozen pipe burst: $5,000-$15,000
- Ice dam water damage: $3,000-$10,000
- Frost heave repair: $10,000-$30,000
- Emergency pumping: $500-$2,000
