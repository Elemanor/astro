# Century Home Basement Retrofit - Comprehensive Waterproofing & Insulation

## Understanding Your Ambitious Plan

Your comprehensive approach to retrofitting a 100-year-old double brick house basement shows excellent planning. Let's analyze each component to ensure they work together effectively while addressing some critical code and practical issues.

### Your Proposed System Overview

**Interior Work:**
- French drain with T-pipe for radon
- Sealed sump pump system
- 2" EPS on walls
- 2x4 stud wall with Rockwool
- Air sealing around joists

**Exterior Work:**
- Skirt insulation
- Underground waterproof "roof"

This multi-faceted approach addresses water, radon, insulation, and freeze-thaw protection - but needs some refinement.

## Critical Code Issue: Sump Pump Discharge

### The Septic Tank Question

**Short Answer:** NO - You cannot discharge a sump pump into your septic system.

As plumb_bob correctly noted: "When you pump storm or other drainage water to a septic system... it is considered cross connected and not allowed."

**Why It's Prohibited:**
- Overwhelms septic capacity
- Dilutes bacterial action
- Causes system failure
- Violates plumbing codes
- Can back up sewage into home

**Legal Discharge Options:**
1. **Municipal storm sewer** (if available)
2. **Grade discharge** (20+ feet from foundation)
3. **Dry well** (if soil percolates)
4. **Rain garden** (with overflow provision)

## Interior French Drain Analysis

### Your Proposed System

**Strengths:**
- Addresses wall-floor joint leakage
- Can integrate radon mitigation
- Less disruptive than exterior work
- Year-round installation possible

**Considerations:**
- Manages water, doesn't prevent entry
- Requires breaking concrete floor
- Must maintain proper slope to sump
- Concrete cap over drain unusual

### Radon Integration Challenges

**Your T-Pipe Concept:**
While creative, combining drainage with radon mitigation requires careful design:

**Potential Issues:**
- Water in drain can block air flow
- Radon fan not designed for moisture
- May reduce drainage effectiveness
- Could create odor problems

**Better Approach:**
- Separate radon system under slab
- French drain for water only
- Both discharge independently
- Maintain system integrity

## Wall Insulation Strategy Review

### Your 2" EPS + Stud Wall Plan

**Good Elements:**
- EPS won't absorb moisture
- Rockwool provides additional R-value
- Maintains air space

**Critical Details:**
1. **Moisture Management**
   - No vapor barrier on concrete
   - EPS acts as vapor retarder
   - Allow wall to dry inward

2. **Bottom Plate Detail**
   - Sits on French drain? Problematic
   - Use treated lumber
   - Consider raising plate above drain
   - Gasket under plate essential

3. **Air Sealing**
   - Embedded joists are challenging
   - Caulk is good start
   - Spray foam in joist pockets excellent
   - Consider rim joist insulation

## Century Home Specific Challenges

### Double Brick Walls
- Highly porous
- No cavity for drainage
- Moisture moves through readily
- Interior insulation traps moisture

### Concrete Foundation (100 years old)
- Likely unreinforced
- May have deteriorated
- Porous concrete common
- Check structural integrity

### Embedded Joists
- Major air leakage path
- Potential rot risk
- Difficult to air seal
- Fire-stopping requirements

## Exterior Skirt Insulation Analysis

### Your Underground "Roof" Concept

**Benefits:**
- Reduces freeze-thaw cycles
- Directs water away
- Protects foundation
- Increases soil temperature

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Excavate 2-4 feet out**
2. **Install rigid foam** (slope away)
3. **Cover with membrane** (EPDM/similar)
4. **Protect with soil/gravel**
5. **Ensure positive drainage**

**Why Not Full Exterior Waterproofing?**
As plumb_bob asked: "If you are going to dig up the outside of the foundation why not install perimeter drainage?"

Good question - partial excavation for skirt vs full depth for drainage.

## Integrated System Recommendations

### Modified Interior Approach

**French Drain System:**
1. Perimeter drain at footing level
2. Minimum 1% slope to sump
3. Filter fabric and clean stone
4. NO concrete cap - use removable covers
5. Separate from radon system

**Radon Mitigation:**
1. Sub-slab depressurization separate
2. Sealed penetrations through slab
3. Dedicated piping to exterior
4. Proper fan sizing for system

**Sump Pump Installation:**
1. Sealed lid (as planned)
2. Check valve (as planned)
3. Discharge to exterior/storm sewer
4. Battery backup recommended
5. Water alarm essential

### Modified Wall System

**Better Assembly (inside to out):**
1. Drywall
2. 2x4 studs with Rockwool
3. 1" air gap (critical)
4. 2" EPS foam board
5. Existing concrete wall
6. No vapor barrier

**Bottom Detail:**
1. Pressure-treated bottom plate
2. Sill gasket under plate
3. Plate sits ON concrete floor
4. Not directly on French drain
5. Leave gap at bottom of drywall

### Air Sealing Strategy

**Embedded Joists:**
1. Remove debris from pockets
2. Apply borate treatment
3. Spray foam to seal
4. Maintain 1" gap from brick
5. Fire-stop as required

**Rim Joist Area:**
1. Cut-and-cobble rigid foam
2. Seal with spray foam
3. Add mineral wool if needed
4. Ensure vapor permeability

## Phasing Your Project

### Phase 1: Water Management
1. Install interior French drain
2. Set up sump pump system
3. Test and refine drainage
4. Monitor moisture levels

### Phase 2: Exterior Work
1. Install skirt insulation
2. Create underground "roof"
3. Improve surface grading
4. Add downspout extensions

### Phase 3: Interior Insulation
1. Confirm dry conditions
2. Install EPS on walls
3. Build stud walls
4. Complete air sealing
5. Install finishes

### Phase 4: Radon (if needed)
1. Test radon levels first
2. Design appropriate system
3. Install sub-slab system
4. Test post-mitigation

## Cost Estimates (Toronto Area)

| Component | DIY Cost | Professional | Priority |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| French Drain | $2,000-3,000 | $6,000-10,000 | High |
| Sump System | $500-1,000 | $2,000-3,000 | High |
| Wall Insulation | $3,000-4,000 | $8,000-12,000 | Medium |
| Skirt System | $1,500-2,500 | $4,000-6,000 | Medium |
| Radon System | $500-1,000 | $2,000-3,000 | As needed |

Total: $7,500-11,500 DIY / $22,000-34,000 Professional

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Discharging to septic** - Never do this
2. **Vapor barriers wrong side** - Causes rot
3. **Insulation touching concrete** - Moisture trap
4. **Ignoring structural issues** - Check first
5. **Poor drainage slope** - System fails

## Success Factors

### What Makes This Work:
1. Comprehensive approach
2. Addressing root causes
3. Proper material selection
4. Phased implementation
5. Code compliance

### Critical Monitoring:
1. Moisture meters in walls
2. Sump pump operation
3. Indoor humidity levels
4. Radon levels (if applicable)
5. Foundation movement

## Final Recommendations

Your plan is ambitious and well-thought-out with these modifications:

**Must Change:**
- Sump pump discharge location
- Separate radon from drainage
- Wall bottom detail

**Should Consider:**
- Full exterior drainage if excavating
- Professional structural assessment
- Permit requirements
- Neighbor considerations

**Nice to Have:**
- Battery backup sump
- Smart home monitoring
- Annual maintenance plan

## Conclusion

Retrofitting a century home basement requires balancing modern performance with respect for the original structure. Your comprehensive approach addresses multiple issues simultaneously, which is efficient.
