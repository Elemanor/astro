## The Foundation Waterproofing Dilemma

When James (lookloan) asked about waterproofing his new 10-inch concrete walls in Northeast Zone 5, he highlighted a common dilemma: liquid membranes like Polywall versus dimple mat systems. His situation - blasted rock on a slope with limited working space - represents typical challenging conditions where choosing the right system matters.

### Understanding the Options

**James's Initial Plan:**
- Polywall joint sealer at cold joint
- Rolled liquid membrane application
- Protection layer (undecided)
- Footing drains with Schedule 40 pipe

Let's analyze both approaches with real-world feedback from contractors.

## Liquid Membrane Systems (Polywall Type)

### How They Work

Liquid-applied membranes create a seamless, monolithic barrier by:
- Sealing cold joints first
- Rolling or spraying rubber/polymer coating
- Building up to 60+ mil thickness
- Curing to flexible waterproof barrier

### Pros of Liquid Membranes
- **Seamless application** - No joints to fail
- **Self-healing properties** - Minor punctures seal
- **Conforms to irregular surfaces** - Good for rough walls
- **Excellent adhesion** - Becomes part of wall
- **Proven performance** - Decades of use

### Cons of Liquid Membranes
- **Labor intensive** - Multiple coats required
- **Weather dependent** - Can't apply in rain/cold
- **Requires protection board** - Vulnerable to backfill damage
- **Higher skill needed** - Proper thickness critical
- **More expensive** - Materials + labor

### Real Costs
James discovered: "GCP Bituthene 3000... I am looking at $6000"

## Dimple Mat Systems (Delta-MS Type)

### Contractor Experience from Zdesign

"I used the Delta MS dimple mat... I highly recommend the Delta Dimple mat. It's very easy to install."

**His Results:**
- Total cost: ~$500 for materials
- Two 8' rolls covered foundation
- 1/4 box of clips used
- Ramset installation worked well
- No additional coatings needed

### How Dimple Mats Work

The raised dimples create:
- Air gap between wall and soil
- Drainage plane for water
- Pressure relief system
- Protection for any coating beneath
- Path to footing drains

### Installation Tips from Experience

**Zdesign's Method:**
1. Overlap sheets 6 inches
2. Install clips every 1' on seams
3. Use closure strip at top
4. Apply tar behind closure strip
5. Check for tears before backfill

**Critical Detail:** "Make sure you unroll the material in the proper direction"

## Cost Comparison Reality Check - Toronto 2025 Pricing

| System | Material Cost | Labor | Total | Time |
|--------|--------------|-------|-------|------|
| Liquid Membrane | $2,000-3,000 | $3,000-4,000 | $5,000-7,000 | 3-4 days |
| Dimple Mat | $500-1,000 | $500-1,000 | $1,000-2,000 | 1 day |
| Both Combined | $2,500-4,000 | $3,500-5,000 | $6,000-9,000 | 4-5 days |

### Toronto Rebates Available:
- **City Subsidy**: Up to $3,400 for waterproofing
- **Federal Grant**: Up to $5,000 (with insulation)
- **Enbridge**: Up to $5,000 (energy upgrades)
- **Total Possible**: Up to $13,400 in rebates

## The Blasted Rock Challenge

### Special Considerations from Onslow

For foundations in blasted rock (like James's situation):

**Water Management Inside Foundation:**
"Spring melt that sinks into the soil layer above the bedrock is known to travel along the sandstone surface"

**Critical Steps:**
1. Power wash rock faces clean
2. Use all washed stone fill (not pit run)
3. Create internal drainage to daylight
4. Monitor with witness pipes
5. Consider Xypex in concrete mix

**Why This Matters:**
"Water tracking under the footings and any wall treatments"

## Hybrid Approach for Maximum Protection

### Based on Real Experience

Onslow's successful system:
1. **Xypex additive** in all concrete
2. **3" XPS foam** on exterior
3. **Grace Bituthene** over foam and footings
4. **Interior drainage** provisions
5. **All washed stone** backfill

Result: "Delightfully dry basement"

## Protection Layer Options

### James's Concerns Addressed

**XPS Foam:**
- Pros: Insulation + protection
- Cons: "Attracts ants and termites"
- Solution: Treat for insects, use borate-treated

**Rockwool:**
- Not recommended below grade
- Absorbs water
- Loses R-value when wet

**Dimple Mat as Protection:**
- Excellent over liquid membrane
- No insulation value
- Superior drainage
- Mechanical protection

## Toronto & GTA Specific Recommendations

### Toronto Climate Considerations
- **100+ freeze-thaw cycles annually** - More than most Zone 5 areas
- **Spring thaw water loads** - March-April critical period
- **Clay soil expansion** - Common in North York, Scarborough
- **Bedrock water tracking** - Issue in Etobicoke, East York areas
- **831mm annual precipitation** - Higher than national average

### GTA Soil Conditions by Area:
- **Toronto Core**: Mixed fill over clay
- **Scarborough**: Heavy clay, high water retention
- **North York**: Clay with sandy pockets
- **Etobicoke**: Clay over shale bedrock
- **Mississauga**: Clay plains, poor drainage
- **Vaughan**: Clay loam, moderate drainage

### Recommended System for Toronto Homes
1. **Capillary break** at footing (essential per OBC)
2. **Liquid membrane** for seamless barrier
3. **Dimple mat** over membrane
4. **Proper drainage** at footing level
5. **Consider interior** drainage too
6. **Comply with Toronto regulations** - No permit needed for waterproofing alone

## Installation Sequence for Success

### If Using Both Systems:

**Day 1-2: Prep and Liquid Membrane**
1. Clean walls thoroughly
2. Apply joint sealer at cold joint
3. Prime if required
4. Roll/spray first coat
5. Apply second coat next day

**Day 3: Dimple Mat**
1. Let membrane cure
2. Start at one corner
3. Unroll correct direction
4. Overlap 6" minimum
5. Fasten per manufacturer

**Day 4: Finishing**
1. Install closure strip at top
2. Seal top edge with tar
3. Install footing drains
4. Place drainage stone
5. Install filter fabric

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong drain location** - Must be at footing, not higher
2. **No capillary break** - Critical at footing/wall joint
3. **Insufficient overlap** - 6" minimum for dimple mat
4. **Poor backfill** - Use drainage material near wall
5. **Skipping internal drainage** - Important for rock sites

## The Bottom Line Decision Matrix

### Choose Liquid Membrane When:
- Irregular surfaces
- Maximum waterproofing needed
- Budget allows
- Skilled applicators available
- Time for proper application

### Choose Dimple Mat When:
- Quick installation needed
- DIY friendly project
- Budget conscious
- Good drainage assured
- Simple wall geometry

### Use Both When:
- Challenging site conditions
- Zero tolerance for water
- Lifetime protection wanted
- Finishing basement
- Cost justified by home value

## Real-World Recommendations

Based on the discussion thread:

**For James's Specific Situation:**
Given the blasted rock, limited space, and slope:
1. Apply liquid membrane first
2. Add dimple mat for protection/drainage
3. Address internal water management
4. Use washed stone backfill
5. Monitor with witness pipes

**Cost-Effective Alternative:**
If $6,000 is too much:
- Skip liquid membrane
- Use quality damp-proofing
- Install dimple mat properly
- Ensure excellent drainage
- Add interior backup system

## Professional Tips

### From Successful Installations:

**Brian Pontolilo (GBA Editor):**
"A capillary break between the footing and foundation wall is a necessary and often overlooked aspect"

**Zdesign's Success:**
- Simple dimple mat system
- Proper installation techniques
- No additional coatings
- Excellent results

**Onslow's Comprehensive Approach:**
- Address water from all sources
- Interior and exterior strategies
- Quality materials throughout
- Monitoring provisions

## Conclusion

The liquid membrane vs dimple mat debate often resolves to "both are good, together they're better." For challenging sites like James's blasted rock slope, the small additional cost of using both systems provides peace of mind and superior protection. However, a properly installed dimple mat with good drainage can provide excellent results at a fraction of the cost.
