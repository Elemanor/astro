# Foundation Waterproofing Product Comparison Guide

## Understanding the Product Landscape

As paxsonalaska discovered, fluid-applied foundation waterproofing products range dramatically from $99 to $300 per 5-gallon pail. The price difference often reflects significant performance variations, but marketing claims can obscure what really matters. This guide cuts through the confusion with real-world experience and expert insights.

### The Critical Question

"What should I actually be looking for here? Are there certain 'go-to' products that people have had success with?"

Let's break down what matters and what doesn't when selecting foundation waterproofing products.

## Product Categories and Price Points

### Budget Tier ($99-150/5 gal)
**Typical Products:**
- Basic asphalt emulsions
- Modified bitumen coatings
- Entry-level latex waterproofing
- Simple polymer coatings

**Characteristics:**
- Limited elasticity (50-200%)
- Basic water resistance
- Shorter lifespan (5-10 years)
- DIY friendly application

**Best For:**
- Good drainage sites
- Temporary waterproofing
- Budget-conscious projects
- Low water table areas

### Mid-Tier ($150-225/5 gal)
**Typical Products:**
- Ames Blue Max ($200/5 gal)
- Quality elastomeric coatings
- Modified rubber coatings
- Enhanced polymer systems

**Characteristics:**
- Good elasticity (300-600%)
- Reliable water resistance
- Moderate lifespan (10-20 years)
- Professional or advanced DIY

**Best For:**
- Most residential applications
- Moderate water pressure
- Value-conscious quality
- Variable site conditions

### Premium Tier ($225-300/5 gal)
**Typical Products:**
- Rub-R-Wall (professional only)
- Tremco Tuff-N-Dri
- Polyguard 650
- Commercial-grade systems

**Characteristics:**
- High elasticity (600-1200%)
- Superior water resistance
- Long lifespan (20+ years)
- Professional application required

**Best For:**
- High water table sites
- Commercial projects
- Critical applications
- Lifetime protection

## Key Performance Metrics Explained

### 1. Elasticity/Elongation

**What It Means:**
Ability to stretch without breaking when foundations move

**Industry Standards:**
- Minimum: 200% elongation
- Good: 400-600% elongation
- Excellent: 800%+ elongation

**Why It Matters:**
Foundations crack. Higher elasticity bridges cracks better.

### 2. PSI Water Resistance

**What It Means:**
Pressure of water column product can resist

**Conversion Reference:**
- 1 PSI = 2.31 feet of water
- 8 feet of water = 3.5 PSI
- Typical basement = 4-8 PSI needed

**Marketing vs Reality:**
Many products claim high PSI but test conditions vary dramatically.

### 3. Permeance Rating

**Often Overlooked But Critical:**
- Measures vapor transmission
- Lower is better for waterproofing
- Should be < 0.1 perms
- Many products don't publish this

### 4. Application Thickness

**Critical for Performance:**
- Minimum: 40 mils wet (dampproofing)
- Recommended: 60 mils wet
- Premium: 80-100 mils wet
- Coverage rates reveal true thickness

## Real-World Product Performance

### Paxsonalaska's Choice: Ames Blue Max

**Product Profile:**
- Water-based elastomeric
- $200/5 gallon
- 650% elongation
- Roll or brush application
- Available retail

**Why This Choice Made Sense:**
- Good drainage site (glacial moraine)
- DIY application possible
- Significant upgrade from dampproofing
- Reasonable cost ($1,200 total)
- Local availability

**Contractor Validation:**
"They told me they've repaired plenty of foundations with dampproofing, but never one with elastomeric rubber coating."

This real-world feedback validates the product choice.

### Professional Favorites

**Michael Maines' Recommendations:**
- **Rub-R-Wall** - Spray-applied professional system
- **Tremco Tuff-N-Dri** - Premium performance
- Both require licensed applicators
- Proven track records

**Key Insight:**
"I would trust the spray-on coatings that require a license to install more than something a homeowner can buy"

## Product Selection Framework

### Site Conditions Assessment

**Good Drainage Sites:**
- Free-draining soil
- Low water table
- Proper grading
- Quality backfill

**Product Needs: Minimal**
- Basic elastomeric sufficient
- Focus on application quality
- Consider dimple mat backup

**Challenging Sites:**
- Clay soil
- High water table
- Poor drainage
- Hydrostatic pressure

**Product Needs: Maximum**
- Premium elastomeric required
- High elongation essential
- Consider multiple systems
- Professional application

### Michael Maines' Holistic Approach

"How well does your site and backfill drain, and how waterproof does your foundation need to be?"

**Complete System Includes:**
- Quality drainage
- Freely draining backfill
- Sleeved drain tile
- Capillary breaks
- Proper insulation

With all elements in place, product selection becomes less critical.

## Application Considerations

### Critical Success Factors

**Surface Preparation:**
- Clean, dry concrete
- No form release agents
- Patch major defects
- Prime if required

**Application Technique:**
- Achieve specified thickness
- Multiple coats usually required
- Overlap each pass 50%
- Check wet mil thickness

**Coverage Rates Reveal Truth:**
- 50 sq ft/gal = ~32 mils
- 40 sq ft/gal = ~40 mils
- 30 sq ft/gal = ~53 mils
- 25 sq ft/gal = ~64 mils

### Peter Engle's Backfill Warning

"Make sure your backfill does not contain big rocks... Bigger rocks can scrape the waterproofing off"

**Protection Strategies:**
- 4" foam insulation (as paxsonalaska used)
- Dimple mat protection
- Drainage board
- Careful backfill placement

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Total System Cost Comparison

**DIY with Mid-Tier Product:**
- Material: $1,200 (Ames Blue Max)
- Labor: Your time
- Protection: Good
- Risk: Application quality

**Professional Premium System:**
- Material + Labor: $5,000-8,000
- Protection: Excellent
- Warranty: Included
- Risk: Minimal

**Basic Dampproofing:**
- Cost: $500-1,000
- Protection: Minimal
- Future repairs: Likely
- Total lifecycle cost: Higher

## Product Recommendations by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Good Drainage, DIY
**Recommended:** Ames Blue Max or similar
- $200/5 gallon range
- 400%+ elongation
- Brush/roll application
- Readily available

### Scenario 2: Moderate Conditions, Professional
**Recommended:** Mid-tier spray system
- Licensed applicator
- 600%+ elongation
- Warranty included
- $3,000-5,000 total

### Scenario 3: Challenging Site, Critical Application
**Recommended:** Premium system (Rub-R-Wall, Tremco)
- Maximum performance
- Professional only
- Complete warranty
- $5,000-10,000 total

### Scenario 4: Retrofit/Repair
**Recommended:** Crystalline or injection
- Different technology
- Interior application possible
- Addresses existing problems
- Varies by condition

## Jon R's Critical Addition

"Add 'sloped, water blocking near surface layer extending well beyond the fill' to the list"

**This Underground Roof Concept:**
- More important than product selection
- Diverts surface water
- Reduces hydrostatic pressure
- Extends system life

## Red Flags in Product Selection

### Marketing Claims to Question:
- "Lifetime" without warranty details
- PSI ratings without test standards
- "Waterproof" without permeance data
- Coverage rates hiding thickness

### Products to Avoid:
- Solvent-based in occupied spaces
- Single-coat "miracles"
- No elongation data provided
- Suspiciously cheap options

## Making the Right Choice

### Decision Framework:

**1. Assess Your Site**
- Drainage quality
- Water table level
- Soil type
- Exposure conditions

**2. Define Performance Needs**
- Required lifespan
- Movement tolerance
- Water pressure resistance
- Vapor transmission limits

**3. Consider Application**
- DIY vs professional
- Weather window
- Access limitations
- Protection plan

**4. Calculate True Cost**
- Material cost
- Application cost
- Warranty value
- Failure consequences

## Conclusion

The $99 to $300 price range reflects genuine performance differences in foundation waterproofing products. While premium products offer superior protection, site conditions and system design matter more than product selection alone.

Paxsonalaska's choice of Ames Blue Max at $200/5 gallon represents a sweet spot for many applications - significant performance upgrade from basic dampproofing at reasonable cost with DIY application possible.

Remember: The best waterproofing combines appropriate product selection with proper drainage, quality backfill, and careful installation. No coating compensates for poor water management.
