# ICF Foundation on Bedrock: Waterproofing Strategies

## The Unique Challenge of ICF-to-Bedrock Interfaces

Steve41's question highlights a complex waterproofing challenge: ICF foundations pinned to shallow, undulating bedrock. With bedrock only 10"-30" below grade and an irregular surface, traditional waterproofing approaches become problematic. His instinct to skip exterior waterproofing deserves careful analysis.

### Understanding the Specific Conditions

**Steve's Situation:**
- ICF foundation pinned to bedrock
- Bedrock 10"-30" below grade
- Undulating bedrock surface
- Planned radiant slab over foam
- Zone 6 climate (frost considerations)

**The Core Question:**
"Given the undulating nature of the bedrock I believe it will be fairly impossible to effectively waterproof along the base of the ICF where it is contoured to the bedrock."

This assessment is largely correct.

## Why Traditional Waterproofing Fails at Bedrock

### The Physical Challenges

**1. Irregular Surface Contact**
- No consistent plane for membrane adhesion
- Multiple gaps and voids
- Impossible to achieve continuous coverage
- Rock texture prevents proper sealing

**2. Water Path Reality**
As Steve notes: "water will wick up into the base of the short concrete wall from the bedrock anyway"

**This is accurate because:**
- Bedrock has fissures and cracks
- Water travels through rock joints
- Capillary action at concrete-rock interface
- No way to seal every pathway

**3. Interior Treatment Paradox**
Steve's observation about needing interior waterproofing too is insightful - if water enters from below, exterior-only treatment accomplishes little.

## The Alternative Approach: Capillary Break Strategy

### Steve's Proposed Solution

"Rather than the waterproofing I would extend the under-slab membrane over the ICF's and a short distance down the exterior of the ICF's into a flashing detail."

**This approach makes sense because:**
- Addresses capillary rise (main concern)
- More achievable than full waterproofing
- Creates continuous moisture barrier
- Integrates with slab protection

### Expert Validation

**Sfortier's response:**
"If you have a capillary break, I would skip waterproofing."

This aligns with building science principles for shallow bedrock conditions.

## Successful Implementation Examples

### Sfortier's Real-World Experience

**Similar ICF-on-bedrock project:**
- Used liquid membrane as capillary break
- Pinned footing to bedrock with rebar/epoxy
- Added weep holes for equalization
- Sand backfill both sides
- 2" rigid insulation for frost protection

**Key Success Factors:**
- Accepted water presence
- Managed rather than blocked water
- Focused on drainage not waterproofing
- Added redundancy (weep holes)

## Water Management Without Waterproofing

### Steve's Comprehensive Plan

**1. Surface Water Control**
- Underground "gutter" with membrane
- Slopes away from foundation
- Standard roof gutters
- Diverts majority of water

**2. Frost Protection**
- Extra foam extending from ICF base
- Takes advantage of bedrock's thermal mass
- Zone 6 considerations addressed

**3. Equalization Strategy**
- Weep holes at low spots
- Expansion membrane around holes
- Slab well above grade
- Accepts controlled water entry

### Why This Works

**Historical Validation:**
Steve mentions: "the structure that I deconstructed... was ~120 years old, with a brick foundation on the same bedrock"

This proves the site can work without modern waterproofing.

## The Crawlspace Alternative

### Akos' Suggestion Reconsidered

**Advantages of Framed Floor:**
- Eliminates slab thermal mass issues
- Faster heating response
- Access to mechanicals
- No concrete-bedrock interface

**Steve's Valid Concerns:**
- Less than 18" clearance
- Below exterior grade
- Access only through floor
- Previous bad crawlspace experience
- Critter concerns

### Making Crawlspace Work on Bedrock

**If Pursuing This Option:**
1. Fully encapsulate with vapor barrier
2. Condition the space
3. Install sump at low point
4. Consider spray foam on bedrock
5. Pest-proof all penetrations

## Code Compliance Considerations

### Steve's Code Officer Approval

"The code officer was all set with this plan (pinning ICF foundation to bedrock above frost line)"

**This approval likely based on:**
- Bedrock's frost-protected nature
- Historical precedent on site
- Proper drainage plans
- Adequate insulation details

### Typical Code Requirements

**What's Usually Needed:**
- Drainage provisions
- Damp-proofing (not waterproofing)
- Frost protection methods
- Structural adequacy

Steve's capillary break approach exceeds typical damp-proofing requirements.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Capillary Break Extension

**Recommended Detail:**
1. **Under-slab membrane** - 10-15 mil polyethylene
2. **Lap onto ICF interior** - 6" minimum
3. **Seal to ICF** - Butyl tape or mastic
4. **Exterior turndown** - 12" minimum
5. **Termination bar** - Mechanical attachment
6. **Cover with flashing** - UV protection

### Weep Hole Design

**For Bedrock Undulations:**
1. **Locate at low points** - Map before pour
2. **Use 2" PVC sleeves** - During ICF setup
3. **Wrap with expansion tape** - Accommodates movement
4. **Install rodent screens** - Stainless steel
5. **Slope to exterior** - Positive drainage

### Additional Frost Protection

**Belt-and-Suspenders Approach:**
1. **Horizontal foam skirt** - 24" minimum
2. **2" thick minimum** - R-10 protection
3. **Slope away 2%** - Drainage function
4. **Protect with membrane** - Longevity
5. **Cover with soil** - 6" minimum

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### What to Watch For

**First Year Critical:**
- Monitor during spring thaw
- Check weep holes function
- Watch for efflorescence
- Document water patterns
- Adjust surface drainage

**Long-term Maintenance:**
- Annual weep hole inspection
- Keep gutters functional
- Maintain positive grading
- Monitor for settlement
- Check capillary break integrity

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Traditional Waterproofing Attempt:
- **Cost:** $3,000-5,000
- **Effectiveness:** Poor (can't seal to bedrock)
- **Longevity:** Questionable
- **Value:** Low

### Capillary Break + Management:
- **Cost:** $500-1,500
- **Effectiveness:** Good (addresses real issues)
- **Longevity:** Excellent
- **Value:** High

### Full Crawlspace Conversion:
- **Cost:** $8,000-15,000
- **Effectiveness:** Eliminates interface
- **Longevity:** Permanent
- **Value:** Depends on use case

## Expert Consensus

### Why Skip Waterproofing Makes Sense

**1. Physics Reality**
- Can't seal to undulating bedrock
- Water finds paths through rock
- Exterior-only treatment insufficient

**2. Cost-Effectiveness**
- Expensive application
- Limited benefit
- Better alternatives exist

**3. Historical Precedent**
- Site worked 120 years without it
- Bedrock provides stability
- Drainage more important

**4. Code Compliance**
- Not required in this case
- Capillary break exceeds minimum
- Official approval obtained

## Best Practices for ICF on Bedrock

### Design Principles:
1. **Accept water presence** - Can't eliminate it
2. **Manage don't block** - Drainage over sealing
3. **Break capillary action** - Primary goal
4. **Provide equalization** - Pressure relief
5. **Monitor and adjust** - Adaptive approach

### Construction Sequence:
1. **Map bedrock carefully** - Identify low spots
2. **Install weep holes** - During ICF setup
3. **Pin securely** - Rebar and epoxy
4. **Apply capillary break** - Continuous coverage
5. **Document everything** - Future reference

## Conclusion

Steve's instinct to skip traditional waterproofing is correct. The ICF-to-undulating-bedrock interface cannot be effectively waterproofed using conventional methods. His proposed capillary break strategy, combined with comprehensive water management, represents a practical and effective approach.

The key insight is recognizing that water presence isn't the problem - uncontrolled water movement is. By breaking capillary action, providing drainage paths, and managing surface water, the foundation can perform well despite the challenging bedrock interface.

Sfortier's successful similar project validates this approach. Combined with the 120-year history of the previous structure, confidence in this strategy is warranted.

## Final Recommendations

**For Steve's Project:**
1. Proceed with capillary break strategy
2. Install weep holes at strategic locations
3. Enhance frost protection with foam skirt
4. Document bedrock elevations thoroughly
5. Monitor first-year performance closely

**For Similar Projects:**
1. Evaluate bedrock drainage patterns
2. Consider crawlspace if clearance allows
3. Focus on water management not elimination
4. Get code official buy-in early
5. Learn from site history
