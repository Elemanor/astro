Fall preparation is crucial for protecting your Toronto home's foundation from winter's harsh freeze-thaw cycles. October and November are your last chance to prevent costly winter damage.

## Why Fall Prep is Critical

### Winter Threats to Foundations
- Water freezing in cracks expands them
- Frost heave can shift foundations
- Ice dams cause water backup
- Snow melt creates hydrostatic pressure

### The Freeze-Thaw Factor
Toronto experiences 40+ freeze-thaw cycles annually:
- Each cycle stresses foundation materials
- Small cracks become major problems
- Proper sealing prevents water entry
- Good drainage reduces pressure

## Priority Fall Tasks

### Water Management
Before the first freeze:
- Clean gutters thoroughly (leaves block winter drainage)
- Extend downspouts 6+ feet from foundation
- Check grading hasn't settled over summer
- Clear window wells completely

### Crack Sealing
Address all cracks now:
- Clean cracks with wire brush
- Apply appropriate sealant for crack size
- Allow proper curing time before freezing
- Consider professional injection for larger cracks

## Winter Preparation Checklist

### Exterior Tasks
- ✓ Remove garden hoses
- ✓ Shut off exterior water
- ✓ Install tap covers
- ✓ Trim overhanging branches
- ✓ Stack firewood away from foundation

### Interior Tasks
- ✓ Check basement humidity (should be 30-50%)
- ✓ Service sump pump and backup
- ✓ Insulate rim joists
- ✓ Seal basement windows
- ✓ Test emergency equipment

## When to Call Professionals

Don't wait until spring for:
- Active water leaks
- Cracks over 1/4 inch
- Bowing walls
- Settlement issues
- Drainage problems

**Winter Emergency Service: (437) 545-0067**

## Cost of Procrastination

Fixing problems in fall vs. spring:
- Fall crack repair: $500-$1,500
- Spring (after winter damage): $2,000-$5,000

- Fall waterproofing: $5,000-$10,000
- Emergency winter repair: $10,000-$25,000
