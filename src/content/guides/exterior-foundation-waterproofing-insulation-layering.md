# Exterior Foundation Waterproofing & Insulation: Getting the Layers Right

## The Three-Layer Question

Bryan's straightforward question reveals a common dilemma: "I would like to insulate and protect my basement foundation walls using a water-based spray on waterproofing, XPS insulation board, and a dimple mat. In what order would they be fastened to the wall?"

His instinct is correct—the insulation should go after the waterproofing. But the complete answer involves understanding not just the order, but why each layer matters and whether you need all three.

### The Correct Layering Order

**From Foundation Outward:**
1. Concrete foundation wall
2. Waterproofing membrane (directly on concrete)
3. Rigid foam insulation
4. Dimple mat (drainage layer)
5. Protective covering (above grade)
6. Backfill

## Michael Maines' Expert Guidance

### The Case Against XPS

"I recommend type 2, 15 psi EPS treated with borates for insect resistance."

**Why EPS Over XPS:**
- **Environmental:** XPS uses harmful blowing agents
- **Performance:** R-value of XPS drops over time
- **Pest Resistance:** Insects burrow in XPS
- **Stability:** EPS maintains constant R-4.2/inch
- **Cost:** Often more economical

### The Pest Problem

Michael notes receiving "feedback including photos of just how much damage can be done to XPS." This real-world experience trumps manufacturer claims about pest resistance.

## Understanding Each Layer's Function

### Layer 1: Waterproofing
**Purpose:** Block water infiltration
**Placement:** Must contact concrete directly
**Type:** Water-based spray-on as Bryan specified

### Layer 2: Insulation
**Purpose:** Thermal protection
**Options:** 
- EPS with borate treatment (recommended)
- XPS (common but problematic)
**Thickness:** Varies by climate zone

### Layer 3: Dimple Mat
**Purpose:** 
- Create drainage plane
- Protect waterproofing during backfill
- Reduce hydrostatic pressure

**Michael's Insight:** "The dimple mat can go on either the interior or exterior of the insulation, since water won't affect the foam"

This flexibility allows for different installation approaches based on site conditions.

## Fastening Methods

### The Challenge
Bryan asks: "How would the dimple mat be attached if the foam board were installed first? How would the foam be attached if the dimple mat were applied first?"

### Fastening Solutions

**For Foam to Concrete:**
- Foam-compatible adhesive
- TapCons with washers
- Hilti IDP fasteners
- Rodenhouse Plasti-Grip PMF fasteners

**Michael's Preference:** "On my projects... I spec Hilti IDP fasteners for interior foam. They (or most other appropriate fasteners) can go right through the dimple mat as well."

### Above-Grade Termination
**Minimum Coverage:** 6 inches below grade
**Protection Options:**
- Parged coating with mesh
- Expanded metal lath
- Sheet metal
- Pressure-treated plywood
- NOT fiber-cement (no warranty)

## The "Is It Overkill?" Question

### Bryan's Valid Concern
"Here's a question, is all 3 of these layers overkill?"

### Michael's Balanced Approach

"When I design my own foundations, I typically spec all three layers... with a note that if the soil drains freely, is not silty and foundation drains lead to open air, that the contractor may eliminate the dimple membrane and/or substitute damp-proofing for water-proofing"

**Decision Factors:**
- Soil drainage quality
- Water table height
- Site grading
- Risk tolerance
- Budget constraints

### The Reality Check
"Most existing foundations and even most new foundations have only damp-proofing, not water-proofing. But I feel safest with a belt-and-suspenders approach, as a leaky foundation is difficult to fix."

## Special Conditions

### ICF Foundations
For the ProHome project, "they just fastened the dimple mat to the attachment strips built into the ICFs"

**Key Point:** "You really shouldn't need much for fastening once the foundation is backfilled"

### Under Garage Slabs
"I would just stop the dimple mat at a convenient height; there is virtually no hydrostatic pressure near grade"

This practical advice saves materials and labor where protection isn't critical.

## The Simplified Alternative: Insulated Drainage Boards

### Bryan's Evolution
"I really like the idea of a dimple mat, but layering all these materials makes me feel like I'm... building a piano. It's pricey, a lot of materials, and possibly complex detailing."

### Combined Products
**Options Mentioned:**
- Owens Corning Insul-Drain
- Dow Perimate

**The Appeal:**
- Single product solution
- Simplified installation
- Reduced labor
- Fewer penetrations
- Integrated functions

### Performance Questions
Bryan asks: "Does anyone have any experience or opinions on how well these boards actually drain, or are they a gimmick?"

**Considerations:**
- Drainage capacity vs separate dimple mat
- Insulation value vs solid foam
- Long-term durability
- Cost comparison
- Installation ease

## The Interior vs Exterior Debate

### Bryan's Perspective
"I know some will say why don't I just do waterproofing on the exterior and insulate the interior. Personally I'd be paranoid covering my foundation wall. I'd like to be able to see any possible cracks, leaks, etc."

**Valid Concerns:**
- Hidden problems
- Moisture monitoring
- Crack development
- Repair access

**Exterior Insulation Benefits:**
- Protects structure
- Warmer wall temperatures
- Continuous insulation
- No interior space loss

## Installation Best Practices

### Surface Preparation
1. Clean foundation surface
2. Repair major defects
3. Allow concrete to cure/dry
4. Apply primer if required

### Waterproofing Application
1. Follow manufacturer coverage rates
2. Achieve specified thickness
3. Pay attention to cold joints
4. Allow proper curing time

### Insulation Installation
1. Stagger joints
2. Seal gaps with spray foam
3. Maintain consistent thickness
4. Protect during construction

### Dimple Mat Details
1. Overlap seams properly
2. Dimples face the wall
3. Secure top termination
4. Integrate with footing drains

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Full Three-Layer System
**Costs:**
- Materials: $8-12/sq ft
- Labor: Moderate to high
- Complexity: High
- Performance: Excellent

### Waterproofing + Insulated Drainage
**Costs:**
- Materials: $6-10/sq ft
- Labor: Lower
- Complexity: Moderate
- Performance: Good

### Basic Dampproofing + Interior Insulation
**Costs:**
- Materials: $3-5/sq ft
- Labor: Low
- Complexity: Simple
- Performance: Adequate

## Making the Right Choice

### High-Performance Approach
Use all three layers when:
- High water table
- Poor drainage soils
- Finished basement planned
- Long-term ownership
- Premium construction

### Practical Approach
Simplify when:
- Well-draining soils
- Low water exposure
- Utility basement only
- Budget constraints
- Proven local practices

### Red Flags
Avoid:
- Skipping waterproofing entirely
- Using untreated foam
- Poor fastening methods
- Inadequate drainage
- Cutting corners on details

## Gotakeawalk's Real-World Success

"Twelve years ago the foundation waterproofing company applied 1" fiberglass drain board which they cut off at grade. I installed 1" foam above their drain board... added metal lath to the outside of the foam to hold the cement parging."

**Key Takeaway:** Multiple approaches can work when properly executed and maintained.

## Conclusion

Bryan's question about layering order opens a broader discussion about foundation protection strategies. While the order is clear—waterproofing, insulation, then drainage—the decision about which layers to include depends on site conditions, budget, and risk tolerance.

Michael Maines' advice balances best practices with practical realities. His preference for EPS over XPS reflects both performance data and environmental consciousness. His willingness to modify specifications based on site conditions shows the importance of engineering judgment over rigid rules.

For those feeling overwhelmed by complexity, insulated drainage boards offer a middle ground—combining functions while simplifying installation. The key is understanding what each layer contributes and making informed decisions based on your specific situation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Order matters:** Waterproofing must contact concrete directly
2. **Consider EPS:** Better long-term performance than XPS
3. **Fasteners can penetrate:** Use appropriate systems for all layers
4. **Simplification possible:** Based on site conditions
5. **Interior access valid:** Some prefer monitoring capability

## Final Recommendations

**For Most Applications:**
1. Apply quality waterproofing to clean concrete
2. Install borate-treated EPS insulation
3. Add dimple mat for drainage and protection
4. Properly detail above-grade transitions
5. Use appropriate fastening systems

**For Simplified Approach:**
1. Consider insulated drainage boards
2. Ensure adequate performance specs
3. Compare total installed costs
4. Verify local code compliance
