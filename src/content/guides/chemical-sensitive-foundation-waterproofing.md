## Understanding the Challenge

When you have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) or chemical sensitivities, choosing foundation waterproofing becomes critical. Traditional asphalt-based products like Watchdog can off-gas for years, potentially affecting indoor air quality even when applied externally. Let's explore safer alternatives that still provide effective protection.

### Why Asphalt Emulsions Are Problematic

**Watchdog and Similar Products:**
- Petroleum-based asphalt emulsions
- Strong odor during application
- VOC off-gassing continues after curing
- Can migrate through concrete over time
- Sensitivity reactions reported years later

**Health Concerns:**
- Headaches and dizziness
- Respiratory irritation
- Skin reactions
- Long-term exposure concerns
- Indoor air quality impacts

## Important Distinction: Damp-proofing vs Waterproofing

As Riversong correctly noted: "Asphalt emulsions are damp-proofing only, not waterproofing."

**Damp-proofing:**
- Resists moisture vapor
- Not effective under pressure
- Typical asphalt coatings
- Minimal protection

**True Waterproofing:**
- Resists water under pressure
- Bridges small cracks
- Provides lasting protection
- Required for basements

## Safe Alternatives for Chemical Sensitivities

### 1. Polyethylene Membrane Systems (RECOMMENDED)

As Armando Cobo suggested, these are excellent low-VOC options:

**Delta-MS/Delta-Drain:**
- High-density polyethylene (HDPE)
- 60-90% recycled content
- Zero VOCs after installation
- No chemical off-gassing
- 20-30 year warranties
- Creates air gap drainage

**Installation Notes:**
- No adhesives required
- Mechanical fastening only
- No chemical exposure
- Can install in any weather
- Immediate protection

**Cost:** $2-4 per sq ft installed

### 2. Crystalline Waterproofing

**For New Construction:**
- Added to concrete mix
- No surface application
- Zero VOCs
- Permanent solution
- Self-healing properties

**Brands:**
- Xypex (additive)
- Kryton KIM
- Penetron

**Note:** Ensure concrete mix has no chemical additives that trigger sensitivities

### 3. Latex-Based Sealers

**UGL Drylok (Water-Based):**
- Latex formula available
- Lower VOCs than solvent-based
- Must specify water-based version
- Allow full cure before occupancy
- Best for interior application

**Limitations:**
- Still contains some VOCs
- Requires reapplication
- Not true waterproofing
- Better as backup system

### 4. Bentonite Clay Systems

**Natural Clay Waterproofing:**
- Sodium bentonite clay
- Completely natural
- No chemical additives
- Swells to seal
- Self-healing

**Forms:**
- Panels (cardboard backed)
- Spray-applied
- Trowel-applied

**Considerations:**
- Must stay continuously wet
- Not for all soil conditions
- Professional installation required

## Products to Avoid with Chemical Sensitivities

### High-VOC Systems:
- Solvent-based asphalts
- Rubber-modified asphalts
- Coal tar products
- Polyurethane liquids
- Solvent-based acrylics
- Hot-applied systems

### Hidden Chemical Sources:
- Adhesives for membranes
- Primers and prep coats
- Crack fillers
- Joint sealants
- Protective coatings

## Best Practice Approach for MCS

### Recommended System:
1. **Exterior:** HDPE dimpled membrane (Delta-MS or similar)
2. **Drainage:** Proper foundation drains
3. **Interior:** Leave concrete bare or use zero-VOC sealer
4. **Backup:** Good site drainage and grading

### Installation Timeline:
- Install membrane immediately after forms removed
- No waiting for chemical cure
- No off-gassing period needed
- Can backfill immediately
- House can be occupied sooner

## Critical Details for Success

### Membrane Installation:
- Overlap seams properly
- Terminate above grade correctly
- Protect during backfill
- Integrate with drainage system
- No chemical sealants at seams

### Drainage Requirements:
- Foundation drains mandatory
- Free-draining backfill
- Proper slope away from house
- Sump pump if needed
- No waterproofing works without drainage

## Indoor Air Quality Considerations

### Even Exterior Applications Affect Indoor Air:
- Chemicals migrate through concrete
- Stack effect pulls air through foundation
- Soil gases carry VOCs
- Long-term off-gassing occurs

### Protective Strategies:
- Create air barrier on interior
- Use ERV/HRV ventilation
- Maintain positive pressure
- Seal all penetrations
- Monitor indoor air quality

## Cost Comparison

| System | Initial Cost | VOC Level | Effectiveness | Lifespan |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Asphalt Emulsion | $ | High | 60-70% | 10-15 years |
| HDPE Membrane | $$ | Zero | 95% | 30+ years |
| Crystalline | $$$ | Zero | 99% | Permanent |
| Bentonite | $$ | Zero | 90% | 25+ years |
| Latex Sealer | $ | Low | 70% | 5-10 years |

## Questions to Ask Your Contractor

1. **Experience with low-VOC systems?**
2. **Can they source HDPE membranes?**
3. **Will they avoid all chemical adhesives?**
4. **Do they understand MCS concerns?**
5. **Will they document all products used?**

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Contractor dismissive of chemical concerns
- Insistence on "standard" products only
- Claims that exterior application is safe
- Unwillingness to provide MSDSs
- Push for quick/cheap solutions

## Making the Decision

### For New Construction:
1. **First choice:** HDPE dimpled membrane
2. **Second choice:** Crystalline admixture
3. **Third choice:** Bentonite clay
4. **Avoid:** All petroleum-based products

### Key Points:
- Drainage is more important than coating
- Mechanical systems beat chemical ones
- Plan for long-term health
- Document everything used

## Working with Your Contractor

### Communication Strategies:
- Provide written requirements
- Specify prohibited products
- Require product submittals
- Get everything in writing
- Have MCS-safe alternatives ready

### Contract Language:
"No petroleum-based, solvent-based, or high-VOC products shall be used for foundation waterproofing. Only approved low-VOC or zero-VOC systems as specified."

## Alternative Approaches

### For Extreme Sensitivities:
1. **Raised foundation:** Minimize below-grade space
2. **Slab-on-grade:** Eliminate basement
3. **Crawlspace:** Easier to ventilate
4. **Interior drainage only:** Manage not prevent

### Supporting Systems:
- Excellent site drainage
- Deep roof overhangs
- Gutters and downspouts
- Impermeable landscaping
- French drains

## Long-Term Considerations

### Maintenance Without Chemicals:
- HDPE membranes need no maintenance
- Drainage systems need periodic cleaning
- Avoid chemical drain cleaners
- Use mechanical cleaning only
- Monitor for settlement

### Future Repairs:
- Plan access for maintenance
- Document system installed
- Keep extra materials
- Maintain contractor contacts
- Photo document installation

## Success Stories

Many MCS sufferers have successfully built with:
- HDPE membrane systems
- No reported sensitivities
- 10+ years symptom-free
- Indoor air quality maintained
- Peace of mind achieved

## The Bottom Line

Your chemical sensitivities are valid and must be respected in construction choices. HDPE dimpled membranes like Delta-MS provide superior waterproofing without chemical exposure. While slightly more expensive initially, they offer better protection and zero VOC exposure - a worthwhile investment in your health.
