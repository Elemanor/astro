**Time:** Weekend project

### 3. Gutter and Downspout Fixes

**Often Overlooked But Critical**

**Steps:**
1. **Clean gutters** - Remove all debris

3. **Seal leaks** - Use gutter sealant
4. **Secure brackets** - Every 24-36 inches
5. **Add extensions** - Underground or above grade

**Success Rate:** 70% for roof water issues

   - Too rigid, cracks again
   - Use flexible sealants

2. **Ignoring the source**

   - Water finds another path

3. **Waterproofing over wet walls**
   - Traps moisture
   - Causes bigger problems

4. **Improper drainage slope**
   - Water pools near foundation
   - Makes problem worse

5. **Cheap materials**
   - Don't last
   - Require frequent reapplication

## When to Abandon DIY

### Call Professionals Immediately If:
- Wall is bowing or moving
- Crack is growing
- Multiple repair attempts failed
- Water entering multiple points
- Foundation settling
- Mold growth extensive

### The 3-Strike Rule:
If you've tried 3 times to fix the same leak, it's time for professional help. The cost of repeated DIY attempts often exceeds professional repair.

## Tools for Success

### Essential Tools:
- Moisture meter ($30-50)
- LED flashlight
- Safety glasses
- Wire brush set
- Caulk gun
- Trowels
- Shop vacuum

### Helpful Additions:

## Final Recommendations

### Start With:
1. Exterior water management (gutters, grading)
2. Document everything with photos
3. Monitor for changes
4. Try simplest solutions first

### Avoid:
1. Interior coatings as permanent fix
2. Ignoring small leaks
3. Major excavation without permits
4. Structural repairs without engineering

### Remember:
- 80% of leaks are from surface water
- Prevention is cheaper than repair
- Some leaks require professional help
- Safety always comes first
