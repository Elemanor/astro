# Waterproofing Textured CMU Foundations: Solutions for Challenging Surfaces

## The 1950s Foundation Challenge

Adam's situation in southern Ontario represents a common challenge: waterproofing older CMU (Concrete Masonry Unit) foundations with mixed surface textures and hollow corner blocks. His instinct that peel-and-stick won't work well on textured surfaces is correct—let's explore why and what actually works.

### Understanding the Specific Challenges

**Adam's Foundation Profile:**
- 1950s CMU construction
- Smooth surface below grade
- Textured surface above grade
- Hollow half-blocks at corners
- Compromised areas already repaired
- New weeping tile being installed

These varying conditions require a versatile waterproofing approach that can handle surface irregularities.

## Why Peel-and-Stick Fails on Textured Surfaces

### Adhesion Requirements

**Peel-and-Stick Needs:**
- Smooth, continuous surface
- Proper primer application
- Full contact adhesion
- No voids or gaps

**Textured Block Reality:**
- Irregular surface profile
- Multiple contact points missing
- Air pockets behind membrane
- Adhesion failure zones

### The Corner Block Problem

"Half blocks in which there is a hollow facing the exterior"

These hollow areas create additional challenges:
- No surface for membrane adhesion
- Water collection points
- Structural vulnerabilities
- Thermal bridging

## The Liquid Membrane Solution

### Jamie's Expert Recommendation

"Do a roll on liquid membrane as per the specs (since it's block I would use a mesh for ease of mind)"

This advice addresses the core challenges perfectly.

### Why Liquid Membranes Excel on Textured CMU

**Surface Conformity:**
- Flows into texture variations
- Bridges minor gaps
- Creates monolithic coating
- No adhesion voids

**Application Flexibility:**
- Brush into difficult areas
- Build thickness as needed
- Reinforce weak points
- Compatible with mesh

### The Mesh Reinforcement Factor

**Benefits of Mesh Integration:**
- Bridges cracks and joints
- Adds tensile strength
- Prevents membrane cracking
- Distributes stress

**Critical Applications:**
- Over mortar joints
- At inside/outside corners
- Where blocks meet foundation
- Around filled hollow blocks

## Product Selection for Canadian Availability

### Jamie's Toronto-Based Recommendations

**Accessible Brands:**
1. **Tremco** - Professional grade, widely distributed
2. **Henry** - Good availability through distributors
3. **CDS (Construction Distribution)**  - Requires business account

**Kiley's Builder Recommendation:**
- **Sika Waterproofing Systems** - Hurricane-tested performance

### Product Availability Reality

Jamie notes: "You'll have a hard time finding sika products in non commercial settings"

This highlights the importance of choosing products you can actually source.

### Consumer vs Professional Products

**Home Depot Options:**
- Limited selection
- Consumer-grade performance
- Convenient access
- Basic applications

**Distributor Products:**
- Professional performance
- Better technical support
- Bulk pricing available
- Contractor relationships helpful

## Surface Preparation Critical Steps

### Dealing with Hollow Corner Blocks

**Jamie's Essential Advice:**
"Fill the half blocks with mortar, mostly to give a surface for the membrane"

**Filling Procedure:**
1. Clean out debris
2. Dampen blocks
3. Pack with mortar
4. Tool smooth
5. Allow proper cure time

### Overall Surface Prep

**Requirements:**
1. **Remove loose material** - Wire brush all surfaces
2. **Clean thoroughly** - Pressure wash if needed
3. **Repair defects** - Fill major voids
4. **Prime if required** - Per product specs
5. **Address moisture** - Surface must be appropriate

## Application Best Practices

### The Systematic Approach

**Step 1: Fill and Repair**
- Address all hollow blocks
- Patch major defects
- Allow repairs to cure
- Verify surface integrity

**Step 2: Prime (if required)**
- Follow manufacturer specs
- Ensure complete coverage
- Allow proper drying
- Check compatibility

**Step 3: Apply Base Coat**
- Work into texture
- Achieve minimum thickness
- Focus on problem areas
- Embed mesh where needed

**Step 4: Apply Finish Coat**
- Build to required thickness
- Ensure uniform coverage
- Check mil thickness
- Document application

### Critical Thickness Requirements

**Typical Specifications:**
- Minimum 40 mils dry
- 60 mils recommended
- 80+ mils at vulnerable areas
- Multiple coats required

## The Drainage Layer Integration

### Jamie's Key Insight

"Then do a drainage layer (dimple sheeting) remember to point the dimples towards the wall. This reduces the hydrostatic pressure against the membrane and let's water drip down to the weeping system. I believe this is key for longevity."

### Why Dimple Sheet Matters

**Protection Functions:**
- Physical membrane protection
- Creates drainage plane
- Reduces hydrostatic pressure
- Prevents backfill damage

**Installation Critical:**
- Dimples face the wall
- Creates air gap
- Water flows freely
- Terminates properly

## Above-Grade Considerations

### Jamie's Practical Advice

"You don't need to waterproof the above grade bricks"

**Why This Matters:**
- Different moisture dynamics
- UV exposure above grade
- Freeze-thaw considerations
- Aesthetic factors

**Transition Zone Treatment:**
- Extend waterproofing 6" above grade
- Protect with flashing
- Consider parging
- Allow for inspection

## System Integration

### Complete Water Management

**Foundation Elements:**
1. New weeping tile (drainage)
2. Liquid membrane (waterproofing)
3. Dimple sheet (protection/drainage)
4. Proper backfill (continued drainage)

**Each Component Critical:**
- Weeping tile removes water
- Membrane blocks infiltration
- Dimple sheet manages pressure
- Backfill maintains drainage

### Backfill Options

**Jamie's Flexibility:**
"Backfill with the dirt you have or gravel for better drainage"

**Considerations:**
- Native soil: economical but less drainage
- Gravel: better drainage but costs more
- Compromise: gravel near foundation, native soil above

## Product Recommendations by Scenario

### For Smooth Below-Grade Sections

**Option 1: Liquid Membrane**
- Easier application
- Consistent thickness
- No surface issues

**Option 2: Peel-and-Stick**
- Could work here only
