      text: "During dry spells, use a soaker hose 18 inches from foundation to maintain soil moisture. Water in early morning or evening."
    - name: "Trim Vegetation"
      text: "Keep trees and shrubs trimmed at least 3 feet from foundation. Remove any roots growing toward the foundation."

      text: "Check for termites, carpenter ants, and other pests. Seal any entry points and treat if necessary."
    - name: "Check Air Conditioning Drainage"
      text: "Ensure AC condensate drains away from foundation. Clean drain lines and redirect if pooling occurs."
    - name: "Maintain Proper Ventilation"
      text: "Ensure basement vents are clear and functioning. Good airflow prevents moisture buildup and mold growth."
    - name: "Re-seal Exterior Cracks"
      text: "Summer heat can cause sealants to fail. Inspect and re-seal any cracks or gaps in foundation and around windows."

Summer in Toronto brings unique foundation challenges from extreme heat, drought conditions, and sudden storms. Proper maintenance during these months prevents costly repairs.

## Summer Foundation Risks

### Heat and Drought Effects
- Soil shrinkage creating gaps around foundation
- Increased settlement risk
- Concrete expansion and contraction
- Sealant failure from UV exposure

### Summer Storm Concerns
- Flash flooding from heavy rains
- Overwhelmed drainage systems
- Power outages affecting sump pumps
- Wind-driven rain penetration

## Critical Summer Tasks

### Soil Moisture Management
Maintaining consistent soil moisture is crucial:
- Install soaker hoses around perimeter
- Water during extended dry periods
- Monitor for soil gaps near foundation
- Avoid overwatering which causes expansion

### Vegetation Control
Tree roots seek moisture during drought:
- Large trees should be 20+ feet from foundation
- Remove aggressive root systems
- Consider root barriers for existing trees
- Keep gutters clear of summer debris

## Professional Services

Summer is ideal for major repairs:
- Exterior waterproofing installation
- Foundation crack injection
- Drainage system upgrades
- Preventive maintenance programs

## Emergency Preparedness

### Before Summer Storms
- Test sump pump and backup power
- Clear all drainage paths
- Seal vulnerable areas
- Stock emergency supplies

### After Storms
- Inspect for water intrusion
- Check for new cracks
- Test drainage systems
- Document any damage

## Investment Protection

Regular summer maintenance prevents:
- Foundation settlement: $15,000-$50,000
- Basement flooding: $10,000-$25,000
- Structural damage: $20,000-$100,000

A few hours of prevention saves thousands in repairs.
