# Summer Foundation Maintenance Guide

Summer in Toronto brings unique foundation challenges from extreme heat, drought conditions, and sudden storms. Proper maintenance during these months prevents costly repairs.

## Summer Foundation Risks

### Heat and Drought Effects
- Soil shrinkage creating gaps around foundation
- Increased settlement risk
- Concrete expansion and contraction
- Sealant failure from UV exposure

### Summer Storm Concerns
- Flash flooding from heavy rains
- Overwhelmed drainage systems
- Power outages affecting sump pumps
- Wind-driven rain penetration

## Critical Summer Tasks

### Soil Moisture Management
Maintaining consistent soil moisture is crucial:
- Install soaker hoses around perimeter
- Water during extended dry periods
- Monitor for soil gaps near foundation
- Avoid overwatering which causes expansion

### Vegetation Control
Tree roots seek moisture during drought:
- Large trees should be 20+ feet from foundation
- Remove aggressive root systems
- Consider root barriers for existing trees
- Keep gutters clear of summer debris
