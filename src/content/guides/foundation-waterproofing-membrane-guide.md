## Understanding Waterproofing Membranes

### What Is a Foundation Waterproofing Membrane?

A waterproofing membrane is a continuous barrier applied to foundation walls that prevents water penetration. Unlike damp-proofing, which only resists moisture, true waterproofing membranes can withstand hydrostatic pressure and provide complete water protection.

**Key Functions:**
- Creates impermeable barrier
- Bridges minor cracks
- Resists hydrostatic pressure
- Protects foundation materials
- Channels water to drainage

### Why Membranes Are Essential

**Toronto's Climate Challenges:**
- Freeze-thaw cycles
- Heavy spring runoff
- Clay soil expansion
- High water tables
- Extreme weather events

**Protection Benefits:**
- Prevents structural damage
- Stops mold/mildew growth
- Maintains indoor air quality
- Protects property value
- Reduces energy costs
