## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly do costs escalate after flooding?
Costs can double within 48-72 hours due to mold growth and secondary damage. Immediate action is critical.

### Can I stay in my home during repairs?
Depends on severity. Minor floods may allow staying, but severe damage often requires temporary relocation.

### How accurate are initial estimates?
Initial estimates may vary 20-30% as hidden damage is discovered. Reputable contractors provide detailed assessments.

### Will my insurance rates increase after a claim?
Possibly. One claim may have minimal impact, but multiple claims often increase premiums significantly.

Absolutely. Properties that flood once have a 40% chance of flooding again without proper waterproofing.
