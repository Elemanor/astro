- Clay soil that expands and contracts

**Urban Challenges**:
- Aging infrastructure
- Combined sewer systems
- Construction disturbing drainage
- Mature trees affecting soil moisture

### Types of Water Problems

**Surface Water**
- Rainwater pooling near foundation
- Poor grading directing water toward house
- Clogged gutters overflowing
- Window well accumulation

**Groundwater**
- High water table pressure
- Hydrostatic pressure through floors
- Seasonal water table fluctuations
- Underground springs

**Moisture & Humidity**
- Condensation on cold surfaces
- Poor ventilation
- Laundry and bathroom moisture
- Summer humidity infiltration

## Signs You Need Waterproofing

### Obvious Signs
- Standing water after rain
