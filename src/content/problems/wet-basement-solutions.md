## Understanding Your Wet Basement

A wet basement isn't just an inconvenience - it's a progressive problem that worsens over time. Whether you're dealing with occasional dampness or chronic water issues, understanding the cause is the first step to finding the right solution.

### Signs You Have a Wet Basement
- **Visible water** on floors or walls
- **Damp or wet spots** after rain
- **Musty, moldy smell** even when dry
- **Efflorescence** (white powder on walls)
- **Peeling paint** or wallpaper
- **Rust stains** on appliances or metal
- **Warped wood** or damaged drywall
- **Increased humidity** throughout home

## Common Causes of Wet Basements

### 1. Hydrostatic Pressure
**The Problem:** Water in soil creates pressure against foundation walls and floors
- Occurs when water table rises
- Worse during spring thaw or heavy rains
- Forces water through cracks and pores
- Can cause floor seepage

**The Solution:** Interior drainage system with sump pump
- Relieves pressure before water enters
- Channels water to pump
- Permanent pressure relief
- **Cost:** $3,000-$8,000

### 2. Poor Exterior Drainage
**The Problem:** Water pools around foundation instead of flowing away
- Improper grading slopes toward house
- Clogged or missing gutters
- Downspouts too close to foundation
- Settled backfill creating low spots

**The Solution:** Comprehensive drainage improvement
- Regrade for positive slope
- Extend downspouts 6+ feet
- Install French drains
- **Cost:** $2,000-$5,000

### 3. Foundation Cracks
**The Problem:** Even hairline cracks let water in
- Natural concrete shrinkage
- Settlement from soil movement
- Freeze-thaw damage
- Hydrostatic pressure

**The Solution:** Professional crack injection
- Polyurethane for active leaks
- Epoxy for structural repair
- Flexible sealants for movement
- **Cost:** $500-$1,500 per crack

### 4. Window Well Problems
**The Problem:** Window wells fill with water
- Poor drainage in well
- Improper installation
- Clogged drains
- Damaged well liners

**The Solution:** Window well rehabilitation
- Install proper drains
- Connect to drainage system
- Replace damaged wells
- **Cost:** $1,000-$2,000 per well

### 5. Condensation Issues
**The Problem:** Humidity creates moisture on cool surfaces
- Poor ventilation
- Lack of vapor barriers
- Cold water pipes
- Inadequate insulation

**The Solution:** Moisture control systems
- Dehumidification
- Vapor barriers
- Pipe insulation
- Improved ventilation
- **Cost:** $500-$2,000
