    {
      "question": "What is Toronto's Basement Flooding Protection Subsidy Program?",
      "answer": "It's a City of Toronto program offering rebates up to $3,400 for flood prevention devices. Homeowners can get up to $1,750 each for sump pumps, backwater valves, and severance/capping. The program covers 80% of installation costs to make flood protection affordable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money can I get from the flooding subsidy program?",
      "answer": "You can receive up to $3,400 total per property: $1,750 for sump pump installation, $1,750 for backwater valve installation, and $1,750 for severance and capping. Each subsidy covers 80% of costs up to the maximum amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who qualifies for basement flooding protection subsidies?",
      "answer": "Toronto residential property owners qualify, including single-family homes, semi-detached, and townhouses. The property must be within City limits, devices must be installed by licensed contractors, and you cannot have received previous subsidies for the same devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I apply for flood protection subsidies?",
      "answer": "Apply online at Toronto.ca within 60 days of installation. You'll need itemized invoices, proof of payment, before/after photos, and permits. Create an account, upload documents, and submit. The City reviews applications in 4-6 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get subsidies for multiple devices?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can combine subsidies for comprehensive protection. Install a sump pump ($1,750) and backwater valve ($1,750) for $3,400 total. Many homeowners install both devices together to maximize protection and subsidies while minimizing disruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What contractors are approved for the subsidy program?",
      "answer": "Any licensed plumber or contractor in Toronto can perform subsidy-eligible installations. They must have proper licensing, insurance, and pull required permits. Experienced contractors familiar with the program ensure smooth applications and approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to receive subsidy money?",
      "answer": "The complete process takes 12-18 weeks: Application review takes 4-6 weeks after submission, approval confirmation takes another 2-3 weeks, and rebate cheques are mailed 8-12 weeks after approval. Submit complete applications for faster processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documentation do I need for the subsidy?",
      "answer": "Required documents include: itemized invoices showing device models and costs, proof of payment, before and after photos clearly showing the installation, any required permits, and the completed online application form. Keep originals for your records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do the work myself and get the subsidy?",
      "answer": "No, DIY installations don't qualify for subsidies. Professional installation by licensed contractors is required to ensure code compliance, proper function, and public safety. The program requires professional invoices as proof of qualified installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my subsidy application is rejected?",
      "answer": "Rejections are rare with proper documentation. Common reasons include: missing documents, DIY installation, ineligible devices, or late application. If rejected, you can usually resubmit with corrected information. Working with experienced contractors prevents rejections."
