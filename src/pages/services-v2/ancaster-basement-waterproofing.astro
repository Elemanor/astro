  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How do you handle natural springs in Ancaster basements?",
      "answer": "We install specialized spring interception systems that capture water before it enters your basement. This includes deep trenches, multiple pumps, and sometimes gravity drainage to manage continuous flow from escarpment springs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you waterproof limestone foundations without damaging them?",
      "answer": "Yes, we specialize in heritage limestone foundations common in Old Ancaster. We use compatible mortars, breathable waterproofing systems, and often recommend interior solutions to preserve exterior appearance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Ancaster waterproofing more complex than other areas?",
      "answer": "The Niagara Escarpment creates natural springs, extreme slopes, and variable bedrock. Combined with heritage properties and modern development pressures, Ancaster requires specialized expertise beyond standard waterproofing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about properties on the escarpment edge?",
      "answer": "Escarpment properties need comprehensive water management including upslope curtain drains, robust foundation waterproofing, erosion control, and often multiple sump pumps. We coordinate with conservation authorities as needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle Heritage Ancaster requirements?",
      "answer": "Yes, we're experienced with Heritage Ancaster designations. We prepare heritage impact assessments, work with approved materials and methods, and coordinate all permit requirements for designated properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does spring water management cost?",
      "answer": "Spring water solutions typically range from $8,000-25,000 depending on flow rates and property layout. This includes interception systems, pumping stations, and discharge management. We provide detailed quotes after assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can springs dry up or change location?",
      "answer": "Escarpment springs can vary seasonally but rarely disappear completely. New construction can redirect springs. Our systems are designed for variability with monitoring to detect changes requiring adjustment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty covers spring water issues?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime warranty specifically covers spring water management. We guarantee our systems will handle your spring water effectively. This includes pump replacements and system modifications if spring patterns change."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to Ancaster emergencies?",
      "answer": "We maintain Hamilton-based crews with typical Ancaster response times of 1-2 hours for emergencies. We stock pumps and materials specifically for escarpment spring water issues common in the area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with Ancaster's luxury home builders?",
      "answer": "Yes, we partner with premium builders in Ancaster for both new construction waterproofing and retrofitting existing homes. We understand the quality expectations in Ancaster's luxury market."
