  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Do I need special foundation work for my addition?",
      "answer": "Yes, additions require foundations that properly integrate with your existing home. This includes structural connections, waterproofing continuity, and matching foundation depths. Poor integration causes separation and settlement issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does an addition foundation cost?",
      "answer": "Basic addition foundations range from $8,000-15,000 for small additions to $30,000-50,000+ for large additions. Adding a full basement typically adds $150-200 per square foot. Costs vary based on size, depth, and soil conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add a basement under my addition?",
      "answer": "Yes, adding a basement under your addition is often cost-effective during initial construction. It requires deeper excavation and proper waterproofing but doubles your usable space. Much more expensive to add later."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does addition foundation work take?",
      "answer": "Most addition foundations complete in 3-4 weeks, including excavation, footings, walls, waterproofing, and backfill. Weather and complexity affect timeline. We coordinate with your general contractor for smooth transitions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my existing foundation is shallow?",
      "answer": "Shallow existing foundations may require underpinning to match addition depth. We assess during excavation and provide solutions. This is common in older Toronto homes and we handle it regularly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do addition foundations need waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Addition foundations need complete waterproofing systems, especially at the connection to existing foundation. Poor waterproofing at joints is a common failure point. We ensure continuous protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work with my contractor?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly work as foundation specialists for general contractors. We handle foundation design, permits, installation, and coordinate timing. Many builders prefer foundation specialists for this critical work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about permits for addition foundations?",
      "answer": "Addition foundations require building permits including engineered drawings. We prepare foundation-specific drawings and handle the permit process. Proper permits ensure code compliance and inspection approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you connect new foundation to existing?",
      "answer": "We drill and epoxy rebar dowels into existing foundation, creating monolithic connection. Proper structural ties prevent separation. Waterproofing membranes overlap to prevent water infiltration at joints."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I include a walkout entrance?",
      "answer": "If your lot slopes appropriately, adding a walkout entrance during construction is cost-effective. It provides separate access, natural light, and significantly increases basement value. Much harder to add later."
