  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to get an underpinning permit in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Typically 6-12 weeks from submission to approval. This includes 2-4 weeks for application preparation, 10-15 business days for initial review, and 5-10 days for each revision cycle. Complex projects or those requiring variances can take 3-4 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does an underpinning permit cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Permit fees are $170.07 per $1,000 of construction value with a minimum fee of $198.59. For a typical $40,000 underpinning project, expect permit fees around $6,800. Additional costs include engineering ($3,000-10,000), surveys, and potential development charges."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need an engineer for underpinning permits?",
      "answer": "Yes, a Professional Engineer (P.Eng) licensed in Ontario is mandatory. They must prepare sealed drawings, calculations, and commit to general review. The engineer will design the underpinning, supervise construction, and certify completion. This is non-negotiable for permit approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documents are required for an underpinning permit?",
      "answer": "Required documents include: building permit application, Schedule 1 & 2 forms, 6 sets of engineering drawings, property survey, geotechnical report, structural calculations, party wall agreements (if applicable), insurance certificates, and WSIB clearance. All must be current and properly signed."
    },
    {
      "question": "When do I need a party wall agreement?",
      "answer": "Party wall agreements are required for semi-detached homes, townhouses, zero lot line properties, or when excavating within 45 degrees of a neighbor's foundation. The agreement must be signed by both parties and submitted with your permit application."
    },
    {
      "question": "What inspections are required during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Mandatory inspections include: excavation (before shoring), reinforcement (before concrete), concrete placement (during pour), backfill (compaction testing), and final inspection. Each requires 48 hours notice and some require the engineer present."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I start underpinning work before getting a permit?",
      "answer": "No. Starting without a permit is illegal and dangerous. Consequences include stop work orders, fines up to $50,000, forced removal of work, inability to sell or mortgage property, and potential criminal charges if someone is injured."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my underpinning project needs a zoning variance?",
      "answer": "Zoning variances require Committee of Adjustment approval, adding 3-4 months to your timeline. This costs $3,000-5,000 and requires neighbor notification. Common triggers include exceeding floor space index or creating basement apartments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can any contractor pull an underpinning permit?",
      "answer": "No. Contractors must have a City of Toronto business license, appropriate trade licenses, $2 million liability insurance minimum, WSIB clearance, and a clean record. Using unlicensed contractors results in permit denial and legal liability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my permit application is rejected?",
      "answer": "Rejections usually result from incomplete drawings, missing calculations, or inadequate documentation. You'll receive specific comments to address. Resubmission typically takes 5-10 days for review. Multiple rounds of revisions are common for complex projects."
