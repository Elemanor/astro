  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the main difference between French drains and weeping tile?",
      "answer": "Weeping tile is foundation drainage installed at footing level (6-8 feet deep) to protect basements. French drains are general drainage systems installed at various depths (usually 2-4 feet) for surface water management. Modern weeping tile uses perforated pipe, not actual tiles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do contractors use these terms interchangeably?",
      "answer": "Historical confusion and regional differences. Both systems now use similar materials (perforated pipe in gravel), but serve different purposes at different depths. Many contractors use 'French drain' as a catch-all term, which causes miscommunication about project scope and cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need weeping tile or a French drain for my wet basement?",
      "answer": "Wet basements require foundation drainage (weeping tile) installed at footing level. French drains are for surface water and won't solve basement water problems. Foundation drainage is code-required and must be installed deep enough to protect the foundation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What materials are used for modern weeping tile?",
      "answer": "Modern 'weeping tile' uses 4-inch perforated PVC pipe (not clay tiles), surrounded by 3/4-inch clear stone, wrapped in filter fabric, and connected to a sump pump or storm sewer. The same materials are used for French drains but installed at different depths."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much more expensive is weeping tile than French drains?",
      "answer": "Foundation drainage (weeping tile) costs $150-250 per linear foot due to deep excavation (6-8 feet) and waterproofing requirements. French drains cost $30-60 per linear foot for shallow installation (2-4 feet). The depth difference drives the cost variance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a French drain replace weeping tile for foundation drainage?",
      "answer": "No. French drains installed at shallow depths cannot protect foundations. Building code requires foundation drainage at footing level. Using a French drain instead of proper weeping tile violates code and won't prevent basement water problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my 100-year-old home's 'weeping tile' made of clay?",
      "answer": "Original weeping tile systems used short clay pipe sections with gaps between them for water entry. The name 'weeping tile' comes from water 'weeping' through these gaps. Modern systems use perforated plastic pipe but kept the historical name."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I communicate clearly with contractors about drainage?",
      "answer": "Describe your specific water problem and ask about installation depth. For foundation issues, confirm the contractor means drainage at footing level (6-8 feet). For surface water, confirm French drain depth (2-4 feet). Get specifications in writing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do French drains require permits in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Surface French drains rarely need permits unless they affect grading, property lines, or connect to sewers. Foundation drainage (weeping tile) always requires permits and inspections because it's structural work covered by building code."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install a French drain myself but need a contractor for weeping tile?",
      "answer": "Yes. French drains for surface water are often DIY-friendly projects. Foundation drainage (weeping tile) requires professional installation due to depth, structural implications, code requirements, and the need for proper waterproofing and engineering considerations."
