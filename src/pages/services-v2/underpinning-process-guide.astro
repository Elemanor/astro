  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How long does the entire underpinning process take?",
      "answer": "Complete underpinning typically takes 4 weeks: Week 1 for mobilization and prep, Weeks 2-3 for the actual underpinning work, and Week 4 for drainage and slab installation. This is significantly faster than most contractors who take 2-3 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I live in my home during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Yes, most clients stay home throughout the process. While weeks 2-3 involve noise and some dust (7am-4pm weekdays), we maintain livability with dust barriers, daily cleanup, and clear access paths. Many find it less disruptive than expected."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in underpinning specifications?",
      "answer": "Our specifications exceed code minimums: 32 MPa concrete strength, 15M vertical rebar at 16\" centers, 10M horizontal bars at 24\" centers, proper waterproofing membranes, drainage systems, and vapor barriers. This ensures long-term performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you maintain structural support during digging?",
      "answer": "We use a proven sequencing pattern, never undermining adjacent sections simultaneously. Typical pattern: sections 1,5,9,13 first, then 3,7,11,15, ensuring continuous support. Maximum 4-foot sections with immediate concrete placement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What special situations require different approaches?",
      "answer": "Party walls need agreements and extra shoring. Rubble foundations require hand digging and preservation techniques. High water tables need dewatering. Rock requires specialized equipment. Each situation has established protocols we've perfected."
    },
    {
      "question": "What drives underpinning costs?",
      "answer": "Main factors: depth (standard 6 feet, premiums for deeper), access constraints (side access adds 10%), soil conditions (rock adds 30-50%), and additional features like heated floors (+$8-12/sq ft) or walkouts (+$15,000-25,000)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties do you provide?",
      "answer": "We offer comprehensive coverage: 25-year structural warranty covering foundation integrity and settlement, 10-year waterproofing warranty for water infiltration, and 5-year workmanship warranty for finishing defects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hidden costs should I know about?",
      "answer": "Often-missed costs include engineering ($2,000-4,000), permits ($1,000-2,000), soil disposal ($2,000-4,000), surveys ($1,500), and party wall agreements ($1,000+). We include these in our quotes upfront."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does underpinning make financial sense?",
      "answer": "Underpinning typically adds $100+ per square foot in home value, enables $1,500+ monthly rental income, and costs less than buying a larger home. When you love your neighborhood and need space, the ROI is excellent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do immediately after underpinning?",
      "answer": "Consider rough-ins while the space is open: bathroom plumbing, electrical upgrades, HVAC planning, and structural modifications. These cost far less during construction than retrofitting later. Even if not finishing immediately, preserve future options."
