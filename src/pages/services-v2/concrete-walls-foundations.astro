      "answer": "Foundation costs vary by scope:\n\n**Repair Costs:**\n- Crack injection: $500-1,500 per crack\n- Carbon fiber reinforcement: $3,000-5,000\n- Wall anchors: $400-600 each\n- Section replacement: $500-800 per linear foot\n\n**Replacement Costs:**\n- Complete walls: $300-500 per linear foot\n- Including excavation: $500-800 per linear foot\n- New footings: $200-400 per linear foot\n- Engineering and permits: $2,000-5,000\n\nFoundation work isn't optional when needed. Early action costs less than emergency repairs.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I repair vs replace foundation walls?",
      "answer": "**Repair When:**\n- Damage is localized (less than 30% of wall)\n- Structure remains fundamentally sound\n- Underlying causes can be addressed\n- Cost-effective solutions exist\n\n**Replace When:**\n- Widespread deterioration exists\n- Repairs would exceed 50% of replacement cost\n- Multiple systems have failed\n- Safety concerns exist\n- Adding stories or major renovations\n\nWe assess honestly based on your situation, not what generates most revenue. Sometimes strategic repairs save tens of thousands over replacement.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does foundation work take?",
      "answer": "Project timelines depend on scope:\n\n**Typical Timelines:**\n- Crack repairs: 1-2 days\n- Wall sections: 1-2 weeks\n- Complete replacement: 3-4 weeks\n- New footings: 1-2 weeks per section\n\n**Managing Disruption:**\n- Most clients stay home during repairs\n- Major replacements might require temporary relocation during critical phases\n- We maintain safe access and protect utilities\n- Daily cleanup minimizes impact\n\nWe provide detailed schedules and communicate throughout the project.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Toronto foundations unique?",
      "answer": "Toronto presents specific foundation challenges:\n\n**Clay Soil Movement** - Our clay expands when wet, shrinks when dry, creating cyclical pressure. We design repairs to handle this movement through proper drainage and flexible connections.\n\n**Freeze-Thaw Cycles** - Foundations must handle freezing conditions with footings below 4-foot frost line, air-entrained concrete, and proper drainage to prevent ice pressure.\n\n**Aging Housing Stock** - Many Toronto homes have 80-100 year old foundations built to different standards. We bring these to modern standards while respecting heritage requirements.\n\n**Urban Constraints** - Zero lot lines and limited access require specialized techniques and equipment for tight Toronto conditions.\n"

<h2 id="the-foundation-below-your-foundation">The Foundation Below Your Foundation</h2>
<p>Footings distribute your home's weight to the soil below. When footings fail, everything above suffers. We install and repair footings for:</p>

<p><strong>New Additions</strong>
Building an addition? It needs footings matching or exceeding your existing foundation. We ensure proper depth (below frost line), width (based on loads), and integration with existing footings.</p>

<p><strong>Underpinning Projects</strong>
[Underpinning](/services/foundation-underpinning/) requires new footings beneath existing ones. We pour these in sections, ensuring continuous support while creating greater depth.</p>

<p><strong>Load Increases</strong>
Adding a second story? Converting to apartments? Increased loads need footing verification and often reinforcement. We assess capacity and strengthen as needed.</p>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="concrete-wall-construction-details">Concrete Wall Construction Details</h2>
<p><strong>Not All Concrete is Equal</strong></p>

<p>Professional foundation work requires attention to details that affect decades of performance:</p>

### Concrete Mix Design
<ul><li>Minimum 25-30 MPa strength for foundations</li>
<li>Air entrainment for freeze-thaw resistance</li>
<li>Low water-cement ratio for durability</li>
<li>Proper aggregate size for placement</li>
<li>Admixtures for workability without weakness</li>

</ul>### Steel Reinforcement Standards
<ul><li>Vertical bars at proper spacing</li>
<li>Horizontal reinforcement per engineering</li>
<li>Adequate concrete cover for corrosion protection</li>
<li>Proper lap splices and corner details</li>
<li>Hooks and bends meeting code requirements</li>

</ul>### Quality Control
<ul><li>Straight, properly braced forms</li>
<li>Vibration for consolidation</li>
<li>No honeycomb or voids</li>
<li>Proper curing procedures</li>
<li>Documentation of conditions</li>

<p></ul>These aren't just technical details - they're the difference between foundations that last 100 years and those that fail in 20.</p>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-other-services">Integration with Other Services</h2>
<p><strong>Waterproofing Coordination</strong>
Every foundation project includes waterproofing consideration. New walls get [exterior waterproofing](/services/exterior-waterproofing/) during construction. Repairs include crack sealing and drainage improvements.</p>

<p><strong>Underpinning Synergies</strong>
When [underpinning](/services/foundation-underpinning/), we often replace deteriorated wall sections. Combining services saves significant cost and ensures comprehensive foundation improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Basement Entrance Creation</strong>
Adding a [basement walkout](/services/basement-walkout/)? We handle the structural modifications, ensuring proper headers and load transfer.</p>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="maintenance-and-prevention">Maintenance and Prevention</h2>
<p><strong>Protecting Your Foundation Investment</strong></p>

<p>Proper maintenance prevents many foundation problems:</p>

### Annual Inspections:
<ul><li>Check for new cracks</li>
<li>Monitor existing repairs</li>
<li>Assess grade and drainage</li>
<li>Inspect parging condition</li>
<li>Look for water signs</li>

</ul>### Preventive Measures:
<ul><li>Maintain positive grading</li>
<li>Clean gutters regularly</li>
<li>Extend downspouts properly</li>
<li>Control foundation plantings</li>
<li>Fix plumbing leaks promptly</li>

</ul>### Early Warning Signs:
<ul><li>Doors sticking or not closing</li>
<li>New cracks in walls</li>
<li>Floors becoming uneven</li>
<li>Windows difficult to operate</li>
<li>Water in basement</li>

<p></ul>Address issues early when repairs are simple and affordable.</p>
