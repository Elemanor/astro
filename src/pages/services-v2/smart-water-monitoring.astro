  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the flood prediction technology?",
      "answer": "DrySpace TechGuard achieves 99.8% accuracy in flood prediction during our 2-year beta testing period. Our AI models are trained specifically on Toronto's weather patterns, soil conditions, and 25+ years of local flooding data. The system provides average 48-hour advance warning before water intrusion events, giving you time to take preventive action rather than react to disasters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my internet goes down during a storm?",
      "answer": "TechGuard includes cellular backup connectivity that automatically activates if your Wi-Fi fails. The system continues monitoring and sending alerts through cellular networks. Additionally, local data storage keeps 30 days of information, and battery backup provides 72 hours of operation during power outages. You'll never lose protection when you need it most."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the smart monitoring system work with my existing sump pump?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! TechGuard integrates with any existing sump pump, drainage system, or waterproofing installation. We add smart sensors to monitor pump performance, water levels, and system efficiency. The technology enhances your current protection rather than replacing it. Integration typically takes 2-3 hours with no disruption to existing systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do insurance companies reduce premiums for smart monitoring?",
      "answer": "Toronto insurance companies typically offer 15-25% premium reductions for documented smart water monitoring systems. Major insurers including Intact, Aviva, and TD Insurance recognize TechGuard as qualified risk reduction technology. We provide all necessary documentation for your insurance company, and the premium savings often pay for the system within 2-4 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the mobile app difficult to use for non-tech-savvy homeowners?",
      "answer": "The DrySpace TechGuard app is designed for simplicity. Most customers master basic functions within 15 minutes. The interface uses plain English alerts, color-coded status indicators, and simple graphs. We provide one-on-one training during installation and offer 24/7 phone support. Many of our satisfied customers are seniors who appreciate the peace of mind without technology complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does the smart monitoring system require?",
      "answer": "TechGuard systems are designed for minimal maintenance. Sensors have 5-year battery life and are self-calibrating. We recommend annual professional system health checks ($149-$249) to optimize performance and update software. The system sends alerts for any maintenance needs, and our technicians can often resolve issues remotely through the cloud connection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does smart monitoring compare to basic water alarms from hardware stores?",
      "answer": "Basic water alarms only detect water after it's already in your basement with 40-60% false alarm rates. TechGuard predicts flooding 48-72 hours in advance with 99.8% accuracy using AI analysis. Our multi-sensor network provides comprehensive coverage vs. single-point detection. Professional monitoring and integration with existing systems offer complete protection rather than just notification."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I monitor multiple properties with one app?",
      "answer": "Yes! The TechGuard app supports unlimited properties under one account. This feature is popular with real estate investors, property managers, and homeowners with cottages. Each property displays separately with individual alert settings and historical data. Volume discounts available for multiple property installations, and bulk monitoring services offered for commercial clients."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during the 30-day optimization period?",
      "answer": "During the first 30 days, our AI learns your basement's unique patterns and adjusts alert thresholds for optimal performance. Our technicians monitor system data and fine-tune settings to eliminate false alarms while maintaining sensitivity. You can contact our support team anytime for adjustments. This learning period ensures the system works perfectly for your specific conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data secure and private with cloud-based monitoring?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. TechGuard uses bank-level encryption for all data transmission and storage. Your personal information never leaves Canada - all servers are located in Toronto data centers. We comply with PIPEDA privacy regulations and never sell or share customer data. You maintain complete control over who has access to your system and can revoke permissions anytime."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the system handle false alarms from humidity or temperature changes?",
      "answer": "Our AI verification system analyzes multiple sensor inputs, weather data, and historical patterns before triggering alerts. This reduces false alarms by 94% compared to basic water sensors. The system learns your basement's normal seasonal variations and only alerts for genuine threats. You can also customize sensitivity levels and quiet periods to match your preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the professional monitoring service?",
      "answer": "Professional monitoring ($29/month) includes 24/7 oversight by certified waterproofing technicians who understand your system and local conditions. They monitor alerts, coordinate emergency response, provide proactive maintenance recommendations, and can dispatch service technicians when critical issues arise. This service is especially valuable for frequent travelers or high-value basement protection."
