  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What is piling in foundation construction?",
      "answer": "Piling involves installing deep foundation elements (piles) that transfer building loads to stable soil layers or bedrock below weak surface soils. Common piling types include driven piles (steel or concrete hammered into ground), drilled piles (augered holes filled with concrete), mini piles (small diameter for limited access), and helical piles (screwed into ground). Piling is essential when surface soils cannot support structure loads."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is piling required for foundations?",
      "answer": "Piling is required when: surface soils are weak or compressible, building loads exceed soil bearing capacity, high water tables affect stability, adjacent excavations threaten foundations, or significant settlement must be prevented. In Toronto, piling is common near ravines, former lakes/marshes, and for high-rise construction. Many underpinning projects use mini piles for added support."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does piling cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Piling costs in Toronto vary by type and depth. Mini piles for residential underpinning: $15,000-30,000 per project. Helical piles: $2,000-4,000 per pile. Driven piles: $5,000-10,000 per pile. Drilled caissons: $10,000-25,000 each. Factors affecting cost include depth to bedrock, access limitations, pile diameter, and number required. Most residential projects need 8-20 piles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between piling and underpinning?",
      "answer": "While both strengthen foundations, piling and underpinning work differently. Underpinning extends existing foundations deeper through excavation and concrete. Piling installs separate deep foundation elements that bypass poor soil entirely. Piling often supplements underpinning in challenging conditions, providing additional support where traditional underpinning alone isn't sufficient."
