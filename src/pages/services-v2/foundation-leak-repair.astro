  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I have a foundation leak?",
      "answer": "Signs include water stains on walls, puddles on floor, musty odors, efflorescence (white powder), visible cracks with moisture, peeling paint, or mold growth. During rain, you might see active water entry. Any moisture in your basement indicates potential foundation leaks requiring professional assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can foundation leaks be permanently repaired?",
      "answer": "Yes, foundation leaks can be permanently repaired using proper methods. Crack injection, exterior waterproofing, and drainage systems provide lasting solutions when correctly applied. The key is addressing the root cause, not just the symptom. Professional repairs include lifetime warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does foundation leak repair cost?",
      "answer": "Foundation leak repair costs vary: crack injection ($500-1,500), partial exterior repair ($5,000-10,000), full waterproofing ($15,000-25,000), interior drainage ($3,000-8,000). Minor leaks might cost under $1,000, while comprehensive solutions for multiple issues can reach $25,000+."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I repair foundation leaks from inside or outside?",
      "answer": "Both methods work, depending on the situation. Interior repairs (injection, drainage) cost less and work well for most cracks and moderate water issues. Exterior repairs stop water at the source and provide comprehensive protection but cost more. Professionals recommend based on your specific leak."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly should foundation leaks be repaired?",
      "answer": "Foundation leaks should be repaired immediately. Water damage compounds rapidly - what costs $500 today might cost $5,000 in six months. Active leaks cause structural damage, mold growth, and foundation deterioration. Emergency repairs are available for urgent situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will homeowner's insurance cover foundation leak repair?",
      "answer": "Insurance typically covers sudden water damage (pipe burst, storm damage) but not gradual seepage or maintenance issues. Foundation cracks from settling, groundwater infiltration, or poor drainage are usually excluded. Document everything and check your specific policy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I repair foundation leaks myself?",
      "answer": "DIY repairs like hydraulic cement or sealants provide temporary patches but rarely last. Foundation leaks require professional diagnosis to identify causes and proper repair methods. Incorrect repairs often make problems worse and more expensive to fix properly later."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes foundation leaks?",
      "answer": "Common causes include hydrostatic pressure, soil settlement, freeze-thaw cycles, poor drainage, aged waterproofing, construction defects, and plumbing leaks. Tree roots, improper grading, and gutter problems also contribute. Multiple factors often combine to create foundation leaks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do foundation leak repairs last?",
      "answer": "Professional foundation leak repairs last 20+ years with proper materials and installation. Crack injections can last the building's lifetime. Exterior waterproofing lasts 25+ years. Interior drainage systems last 20+ years with maintenance. Quality repairs include lifetime warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can foundation leaks cause structural damage?",
      "answer": "Yes, foundation leaks cause serious structural damage over time. Water erodes concrete, corrodes reinforcing steel, causes soil washout, enables freeze-thaw damage, and leads to foundation settlement. Chronic leaks can compromise structural integrity, requiring expensive repairs."
