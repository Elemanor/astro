  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What is the simple definition of underpinning?",
      "answer": "Underpinning is the process of strengthening a building's foundation by extending it deeper into the ground. This is done either to fix foundation problems or to create more usable space by lowering basement floors. Think of it as giving your house deeper, stronger 'roots.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does underpinning mean in construction terms?",
      "answer": "In construction, underpinning means modifying existing foundations to transfer building loads to a deeper, more stable soil level. This involves excavating beneath current foundations and creating new structural supports, either to stabilize settling foundations or enable deeper excavations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between underpinning and foundation repair?",
      "answer": "Underpinning is a specific type of foundation repair that extends foundations deeper. General foundation repair might include crack injection, waterproofing, or minor stabilization. Underpinning is more extensive, actually rebuilding foundations at a lower level for permanent solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do engineers define underpinning?",
      "answer": "Engineers define underpinning as a geotechnical and structural process that transfers building loads through existing foundations to competent strata at greater depth. It requires analysis of soil mechanics, load paths, and sequential construction methods to maintain stability throughout the work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'underpinning a basement' specifically mean?",
      "answer": "Underpinning a basement means lowering the basement floor by excavating beneath existing foundation walls and creating new footings at a deeper level. This transforms low-ceiling basements (typically 6 feet) into full-height spaces (8-9 feet) suitable for living areas or legal apartments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it called 'underpinning'?",
      "answer": "The term combines 'under' (beneath) and 'pinning' (supporting), literally meaning 'supporting from underneath.' Historically, it described the process of placing new supports under existing structures, like pinning something in place from below."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the legal definition of underpinning?",
      "answer": "Legally, underpinning is defined as structural work extending existing foundations to lower elevations. Building codes classify it as major structural modification requiring permits, professional engineering, and inspections. It must be disclosed in real estate transactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there different types of underpinning?",
      "answer": "Yes, main types include: Mass Concrete (traditional dig and pour), Mini-Pile (small diameter piles), Beam and Base (reinforced concrete beams), Screw Piles (helical steel piles), and Jet Grouting (cement soil mixing). Each suits different soil conditions and project requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What triggers the need for underpinning?",
      "answer": "Underpinning is needed when: foundations settle or fail, basement ceiling height must increase, adjacent excavation threatens stability, building loads increase, soil conditions deteriorate, or code compliance requires deeper foundations. Both structural necessity and property improvement drive underpinning decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does underpinning relate to building codes?",
      "answer": "Building codes define underpinning requirements including minimum depths, structural design standards, permit requirements, and inspection protocols. In Ontario, underpinning must meet Ontario Building Code requirements for foundation depth, frost protection, and structural adequacy, with professional engineering required."
