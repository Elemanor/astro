  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How do I find reliable French drain installation near me?",
      "answer": "Look for local contractors with 10+ years of drainage experience, proper licensing and insurance, verifiable neighborhood references, and specialized French drain equipment. Check their physical local address, Better Business Bureau rating, and recent local project examples. Ask neighbors for recommendations and verify they offer detailed written estimates with system specifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost of French drain installation in my Toronto area?",
      "answer": "Interior French drains range $2,800-$7,000, exterior systems $3,800-$8,500, depending on your specific area and requirements. Downtown Toronto commands premium pricing due to access challenges, while suburban areas offer competitive rates. Ravine lots and complex topography may increase costs. Get multiple local quotes for accurate pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does French drain installation take near me?",
      "answer": "Interior French drain installation typically takes 2-3 days, exterior systems take 3-5 days depending on length and complexity. Local contractors often work faster due to nearby material suppliers and familiarity with local soil conditions. Weather affects exterior installations, while interior work proceeds year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for French drain installation in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Exterior French drains typically require building permits in Toronto area municipalities. Interior installations may need electrical permits for sump pump connections. Reputable local contractors handle all permit applications and inspections, understanding specific requirements for your city and maintaining relationships with local inspectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can French drains be installed in winter near me?",
      "answer": "Interior French drains can be installed year-round regardless of weather. Exterior installations are weather-dependent but many local contractors work through winter using heated enclosures and specialized techniques. Frozen ground may delay excavation, but emergency installations proceed when necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do French drains work in Toronto's clay soil?",
      "answer": "Clay soil requires specialized French drain design with proper filter fabric, larger gravel, and enhanced drainage capacity. Local contractors use clay-specific materials and installation techniques, often including surface water diversion to reduce subsurface pressure. Proper design prevents clogging and ensures long-term performance in clay conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between local and national French drain companies?",
      "answer": "Local companies offer faster response, better knowledge of Toronto soil conditions and building codes, lower costs (no travel charges), established community reputation, and ongoing local support. They understand neighborhood-specific drainage challenges, have relationships with local suppliers, and their reputation depends on local customer satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do French drains last when properly installed?",
      "answer": "Professional French drain installations last 30-50 years with proper maintenance. Quality materials, correct installation techniques, and regular maintenance extend lifespan. Local contractors provide ongoing support and maintenance services, ensuring optimal performance throughout the system's life. Annual inspections help identify issues before they become problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can French drains solve my basement flooding problems?",
      "answer": "French drains are highly effective for basement flooding prevention when properly designed for your specific conditions. Interior systems manage water after entry, exterior systems prevent water from reaching foundations. Local experts assess your situation and recommend the best approach for your neighborhood's conditions and your property's needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do French drain installations come with warranties?",
      "answer": "Reputable local contractors offer comprehensive warranties from 25 years to lifetime on materials and installation. Local warranties are valuable because companies maintain physical presence for ongoing service. Look for transferable warranties, annual inspection inclusion, and emergency support. Verify warranty terms and local service capabilities."
