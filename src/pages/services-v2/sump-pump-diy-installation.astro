  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What size sump pump do I need for my basement?",
      "answer": "Most homes need a 1/3 HP pump (2,500-3,000 GPH). If you have high water volume or a deep pit, go with 1/2 HP. Calculate based on: pit size, water inflow rate, and discharge height. When in doubt, go larger - oversizing is better than undersizing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install a sump pump without breaking concrete?",
      "answer": "No, proper installation requires breaking concrete to install a pit at least 18 inches wide and 30 inches deep. Surface-mounted pumps or pumps in buckets don't work effectively and don't meet code. The pit must be below floor level to collect water."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit to install a sump pump?",
      "answer": "You'll need an electrical permit for the new dedicated circuit (required by code). Some municipalities also require a plumbing permit. Check local requirements - working without permits can void insurance and cause problems during home sales."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I discharge my sump pump water?",
      "answer": "Discharge must be at least 6 feet from your foundation, preferably 10+ feet. You can discharge to your lawn, storm sewer (if permitted), or dry well. NEVER discharge to sanitary sewers - it's illegal and results in heavy fines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How deep should the sump pit be?",
      "answer": "Ontario Building Code requires minimum 30 inches deep. Deeper is better - 36-42 inches provides more capacity and prevents short cycling. The pit should extend below your foundation footings to collect water before it enters the basement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use an extension cord for my sump pump?",
      "answer": "No! Code requires a dedicated circuit with permanent wiring. Extension cords are fire hazards, can trip breakers under load, and may not provide proper grounding. Install a proper GFCI-protected outlet at least 4 feet above the floor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I install a battery backup system?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially if you have a finished basement or high water table. Power failures often occur during storms when you need the pump most. Battery backups cost $600-1,200 but can prevent thousands in flood damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my new sump pump run every few minutes?",
      "answer": "Short cycling usually means the pit is too small or the pump is too powerful. The pump should run for at least 10-15 seconds per cycle. If cycling is too frequent, you may need a larger pit or a pump with adjustable float settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install the check valve horizontally?",
      "answer": "No, check valves must be installed vertically to work properly. Horizontal installation causes premature failure and water hammer. Install the check valve directly above the pump in the vertical discharge pipe."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does DIY sump pump installation actually cost?",
      "answer": "Total DIY cost typically runs $800-1,500: pump ($200-400), pit ($100-200), concrete work ($100), discharge piping ($100-200), electrical supplies ($200-300), tool rental ($100-200). Professional installation costs $1,500-3,000, making DIY savings $700-1,500."
