    {
      "question": "What exactly is underpinning a basement?",
      "answer": "Underpinning a basement means lowering your basement floor by digging beneath your existing foundation and creating new, deeper footings. This process transforms low-ceiling basements (typically 6 feet) into full-height living spaces (8-9 feet) by essentially moving your basement floor down rather than raising your house up."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the underpinning process work?",
      "answer": "Underpinning works by excavating beneath your foundation in small sections (3-4 feet), pouring new concrete footings at the desired depth, then connecting them to your existing foundation. Once the perimeter is complete, the interior is excavated and a new floor poured. The house is fully supported throughout the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Toronto homes need underpinning?",
      "answer": "Toronto homes need underpinning primarily to create legal basement apartments (requiring 6'5\" minimum height), add valuable living space, and increase property value. Many Toronto homes built before 1960 have low basements that can't be used effectively without underpinning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is underpinning safe for my house?",
      "answer": "Yes, underpinning is safe when done by experienced professionals. The sequential excavation method ensures your home is always supported. Thousands of Toronto homes have been successfully underpinned. Structural engineers design the process, and city inspections ensure safety throughout."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does basement underpinning typically cost?",
      "answer": "Basement underpinning costs $350-500 per linear foot in Toronto. A typical 30x40 foot home needs about 140 linear feet, totaling $45,000-70,000. Costs vary based on soil conditions, depth required, and accessibility. This includes excavation, underpinning, waterproofing, and new floor."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does underpinning take to complete?",
      "answer": "A typical underpinning project takes 6-8 weeks: 2 weeks for permits and preparation, 3-4 weeks for underpinning and excavation, 1-2 weeks for waterproofing and floor pouring. Weather and soil conditions can affect timeline. You can usually stay in your home throughout."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between underpinning and benching?",
      "answer": "Underpinning digs beneath your foundation to maintain full floor space with vertical walls. Benching creates an angled concrete 'bench' along the walls, losing 30-40% of floor space but costing less. Underpinning is preferred for maximum space and value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can any house be underpinned?",
      "answer": "Most houses can be underpinned, but factors like foundation type, soil conditions, and neighboring structures affect feasibility. Stone foundations, rubble foundations, and houses on poor soil may need special techniques. Professional assessment determines your options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will underpinning increase my property value?",
      "answer": "Yes, underpinning typically adds $200-400 per square foot of new space created. A 1,000 sq ft basement can add $200,000-400,000 in value in good Toronto neighborhoods. Legal rental unit potential provides additional value through income generation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for underpinning?",
      "answer": "Yes, underpinning requires building permits from the City of Toronto. You'll need engineered drawings, permit applications, and various inspections. Professional contractors handle the permit process. Permits typically take 2-3 weeks and cost $2,000-5,000."

<p><strong>Basement underpinning</strong> is the process of lowering your basement floor by excavating beneath your existing foundation and creating new, deeper footings. This allows you to transform a 6-foot crawlspace into a full-height basement without raising your house.</p>
