  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Why is waterproofing more challenging in Cliffcrest?",
      "answer": "Cliffcrest's location near the Bluffs creates unique challenges: high water tables from underground springs, sandy soil allowing rapid water movement, and slope-induced pressure. These require specialized solutions beyond standard waterproofing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special permits near the Scarborough Bluffs?",
      "answer": "Properties within the Toronto Region Conservation Authority's regulated area may need additional permits. We handle all permit applications and have established relationships with TRCA staff for smooth approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle the high water table in Cliffcrest?",
      "answer": "We install systems designed for continuous water management including deep drainage systems, multiple sump pumps, and heavy-duty waterproofing membranes. Our solutions work with the natural water flow rather than trying to block it completely."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about erosion concerns on slope properties?",
      "answer": "We assess slope stability during inspection and include erosion control in our waterproofing plans. This may involve retaining walls, surface drainage, and vegetation recommendations to protect your foundation long-term."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you waterproof without damaging my Bluffs views?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We understand the value of Bluffs views and design our work to maintain sightlines. Interior waterproofing often provides full protection without any exterior disruption to landscaping or views."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can water problems develop in Cliffcrest?",
      "answer": "Due to sandy soil and springs, water problems can develop rapidly in Cliffcrest, especially during spring thaw or heavy rains. We offer 24/7 emergency response typically within 2 hours for active flooding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty applies to high water table areas?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime warranty fully covers high water table installations. We specifically design systems for continuous water presence and guarantee their performance. The warranty is transferable, protecting your property value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you coordinate with neighbors on slope properties?",
      "answer": "Yes, water management on slopes often affects multiple properties. We coordinate with neighbors to ensure comprehensive solutions and can offer group discounts when multiple homes need work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Cliffcrest's springs affect basements?",
      "answer": "Underground springs create constant hydrostatic pressure and can cause sudden flooding during seasonal changes. We map spring locations and install interception systems to redirect water before it reaches foundations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is financing available for major waterproofing projects?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer flexible financing including 0% interest options. Given Cliffcrest's unique challenges often require comprehensive solutions, most clients appreciate our payment plans that make protection affordable."
