  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What is Toronto's official frost line depth?",
      "answer": "Toronto's frost line is 4 feet (1.2 meters) below grade. This is the minimum depth required by Ontario Building Code for all foundations, footings, and water lines to prevent frost damage. This depth is based on historical weather data and soil conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do foundations need to be below the frost line?",
      "answer": "When water in soil freezes, it expands 9% with forces up to 50,000 pounds per square foot. This 'frost heave' can lift foundations, causing cracks, structural damage, and uneven settling. Foundations below the frost line avoid this destructive freeze-thaw cycle."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my foundation is too shallow?",
      "answer": "Shallow foundations experience annual frost heave - lifting in winter, settling in spring. This causes progressive damage: cracks widen yearly, doors/windows stick, walls separate, and eventually major structural repairs are needed. Century homes often have this problem."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I tell if frost is affecting my foundation?",
      "answer": "Signs include: seasonal cracks that open/close, doors/windows that stick in winter, vertical cracks in foundation walls, heaved concrete walkways/driveways, and gaps between additions and main house. Damage typically worsens each year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I fix a shallow foundation without underpinning?",
      "answer": "Temporary measures include improving drainage, installing insulation, and managing surface water. However, these are band-aids. Underpinning to proper depth is the only permanent solution for foundations above the frost line."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do all parts of my foundation need to be 4 feet deep?",
      "answer": "Yes, all footings must extend below frost line. This includes house foundations, attached garages, porches, decks, and additions. Shallow sections create weak points where frost damage concentrates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Toronto's climate affect frost damage?",
      "answer": "Toronto experiences 50+ freeze-thaw cycles annually, making it worse than consistently cold climates. Each cycle moves foundations slightly. Winnipeg freezes once and stays frozen - less damaging than our constant temperature swings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about frost protection for water lines?",
      "answer": "Water service lines must be below 4 feet to prevent freezing. Municipal connections are typically 5-6 feet deep. Shallow lines risk freezing, requiring expensive emergency repairs. Heat trace and insulation help but aren't substitutes for proper depth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is climate change affecting frost line requirements?",
      "answer": "Current code still requires 4 feet, but climate change brings more extreme temperature swings and freeze-thaw cycles. Some engineers recommend exceeding minimums. Focus on excellent drainage becomes even more critical with volatile weather patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does insurance cover frost damage to foundations?",
      "answer": "Usually not. Most policies exclude gradual deterioration, earth movement, and frost heave. They may cover sudden collapse but not progressive damage. Document all issues and maintenance to support any claims. Prevention is your best protection."
