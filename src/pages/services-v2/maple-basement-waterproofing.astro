  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Is your waterproofing work safe around children?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Child safety is our top priority. We use non-toxic materials, secure all work areas with barriers, store equipment safely, and train crews specifically for working around families. Many of our technicians are parents themselves and understand family safety concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you minimize disruption to family routines?",
      "answer": "We work around your family's schedule, including school hours, nap times, and activity schedules. We maintain clean, organized work sites, complete daily cleanup, and can adjust timing for important family events. Many families continue normal routines during our projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work around my children's playroom or recreation room?",
      "answer": "Yes, protecting family recreation spaces is our specialty. We can often install systems without major disruption to finished basements, and when access is needed, we coordinate carefully to minimize impact on family spaces and restore areas quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about noise levels during work?",
      "answer": "We use quieter equipment when possible and schedule noisy work during appropriate hours. We coordinate with families to avoid disrupting nap times, study periods, or quiet family time. Most interior work is relatively quiet compared to exterior excavation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle pets during waterproofing projects?",
      "answer": "We're very pet-friendly and work around family pets regularly. We secure work areas to keep pets safe, coordinate with pet schedules, and ensure crews are comfortable with animals. Many of our team members are pet owners and understand these concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work while we're on vacation or away?",
      "answer": "Yes, many families prefer this approach. We coordinate with neighbors, provide daily updates with photos, ensure complete security, and have the work finished when you return. This eliminates disruption to family routines entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "What financing options work for family budgets?",
      "answer": "We offer family-friendly financing including low monthly payments, seasonal payment options, and programs that work with family budgets. We understand families have many expenses and work to make proper waterproofing affordable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will the work take?",
      "answer": "Most Maple family home projects take 3-5 days for interior systems, 5-8 days for exterior work. We provide detailed schedules, work efficiently to minimize family disruption, and can often work around key family events or schedules."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty protection do families get?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime transferable warranty protects your family's investment for as long as you own your home and transfers to new owners if you move. This provides peace of mind for growing families and protects your home's value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with homeowner associations or community standards?",
      "answer": "Yes, we understand community standards and work within neighborhood guidelines. We maintain professional appearance, coordinate with community requirements, and ensure our work reflects positively on the neighborhood."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you accommodate large family gatherings or events?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We coordinate work schedules around family events, holidays, parties, and gatherings. Many families schedule work specifically to have dry, comfortable basements ready for family celebrations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What emergency support do you provide for families?",
      "answer": "We provide 24/7 emergency response with priority service for families with young children. Our emergency crews understand the urgency of water problems when children are involved and respond quickly to restore safe, dry conditions."
