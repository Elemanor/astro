  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How loud is underpinning construction really?",
      "answer": "Jackhammering reaches 90-100 dB (like a lawnmower) for 2-4 hours per section. The excavation conveyor runs at 70-80 dB (vacuum cleaner level) most of the day. Concrete days add mixer noise at 80-85 dB for 2-3 hours. It's loud but manageable with planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I stay in my home during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Yes, most people stay home during underpinning. The intense phase lasts 2-3 weeks. Consider temporary accommodation if you work nights, have a newborn, or are sensitive to noise/dust. Many people work from home successfully by setting up in the quietest room."
    },
    {
      "question": "What time does construction start and end?",
      "answer": "Toronto bylaws permit construction from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM weekdays, 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM Saturdays. Most crews work 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM with 30 minutes cleanup. No Sunday work unless emergency. Workers arrive around 6:45 AM to prepare."
    },
    {
      "question": "How bad is the dust during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Concrete breaking creates the most dust. Professional contractors use plastic barriers, negative air machines, and water misting, but some dust escapes. Expect to change furnace filters weekly, wipe surfaces daily, and find dust in unexpected places despite best efforts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will underpinning damage my sidewalks and landscaping?",
      "answer": "Professional contractors protect sidewalks with plywood and plastic sheeting. Some lawn damage occurs from equipment and foot traffic. Good contractors restore landscaping at project end. Document existing conditions and ensure restoration is in your contract."
    },
    {
      "question": "What utilities might be disrupted during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Water may be shut off for 2-4 hours occasionally with 24-hour notice. Power interruptions are brief and rare. Gas and sewer typically maintain service. Internet/cable lines need protection. Keep contractor's cell number for emergencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much vibration is normal during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Jackhammering causes noticeable vibration throughout the house - pictures may shift and you'll feel it in your feet. This is normal and within structural tolerance. Contractors install crack monitors and stop work if unusual movement occurs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do contractors transport concrete to my basement?",
      "answer": "When pumping isn't possible, workers use wheelbarrows - typically 100+ trips per pour. This creates a 'wheelbarrow highway' along your property for 3-4 hours. Expect constant traffic, rumbling sounds, and workers calling out. Pathways are protected with plywood."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I remove valuables during underpinning?",
      "answer": "Secure fragile items and remove valuable wall hangings in work areas. Vibration can shift items on shelves. Important documents and electronics should be protected from dust. Consider storing extremely valuable or irreplaceable items off-site during construction."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I maintain good relations with neighbors during construction?",
      "answer": "Inform neighbors before work starts, provide contractor contact information, and apologize in advance for inconvenience. Share the timeline and address concerns quickly. Good contractors minimize street blockage and clean up daily. Consider a small gesture like a gift card after completion."
