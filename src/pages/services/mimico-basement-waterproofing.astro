  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Why do Mimico basements have more water problems than other areas?",
      "answer": "Mimico's location on Lake Ontario creates a permanently high water table, often just 2-3 feet below ground. Combined with sandy soil that transmits water quickly and lake effect weather that creates extended wet periods, basements face constant hydrostatic pressure and moisture challenges."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you waterproof a basement below the water table?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is common in Mimico. We use specialized interior systems designed for constant water pressure, including high-capacity drainage and multiple sump pumps. The key is managing water flow rather than trying to block it completely - we channel water safely away from living spaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do lake effects impact waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Lake Ontario creates unique challenges including extended humid periods, salt air corrosion, storm surges that temporarily raise water levels, and freeze-thaw cycles. Our systems are designed with marine-grade materials and enhanced drainage to handle these harsh lakefront conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's different about working in sandy soil?",
      "answer": "Sandy soil allows rapid water movement but also quick drainage. Excavation requires different techniques than clay areas, and we use specialized backfill materials. Sandy soil also provides less foundation support, so we often combine waterproofing with stabilization work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle emergency flooding in Mimico?",
      "answer": "We maintain 24/7 emergency response specifically for lakefront properties with response times under 2 hours. Our crews are equipped for rapid water removal, temporary protection measures, and coordination with emergency services during storm events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can sump pumps handle Mimico's water table?",
      "answer": "Standard pumps often can't. We install high-capacity systems with backup pumps and battery power for extended outages. Many Mimico homes need multiple pumps due to constant water flow. We size systems specifically for each property's water table conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with condo buildings near the lake?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly work with waterfront condominiums and understand their unique challenges including shared drainage systems, building management coordination, and minimal resident disruption. We're experienced with condo board requirements and insurance needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does waterproofing take in sandy soil?",
      "answer": "Sandy soil actually allows faster excavation than clay, but requires more careful backfill and drainage installation. Interior systems take 3-4 days, exterior projects 4-6 days depending on water table conditions. Weather and water levels affect timing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty coverage applies to high water table conditions?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime transferable warranty fully covers high water table applications. We're confident in our Mimico-specific systems because they're designed for these challenging conditions. The warranty includes provisions for lakefront environmental factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work during winter near the lake?",
      "answer": "Yes, though lake effect weather requires flexible scheduling. We monitor conditions closely and adjust work plans for safety and quality. Emergency services continue year-round, and we maintain heated equipment for winter operations when needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you protect against salt air corrosion?",
      "answer": "We use marine-grade materials designed for coastal environments, including corrosion-resistant metals and enhanced protective coatings. All materials are selected specifically for salt air exposure, and we provide additional protection for vulnerable components."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer financing for lakefront waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Yes, including programs specifically for coastal property owners who may need more extensive systems. We understand lakefront waterproofing often requires larger investments and work to make proper protection affordable for Mimico homeowners."
