  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Why do new Woodbridge homes have water problems?",
      "answer": "Rapid construction and cost pressures often lead to inadequate waterproofing installation. Common issues include poor membrane application, inadequate drainage systems, and failure to account for Woodbridge's challenging clay soil conditions. Many builders use minimum code requirements rather than optimal solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you fix waterproofing without voiding my builder warranty?",
      "answer": "Yes, we work carefully within warranty frameworks. Our solutions often support warranty claims by providing proper documentation of defects. We coordinate with builders and warranty companies, ensuring our work complements rather than conflicts with existing coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Woodbridge's clay soil affect new homes?",
      "answer": "Clay soil creates enormous pressure against new foundations as it expands and contracts. New construction often hasn't had time to settle, making foundations more vulnerable to clay movement. This combination frequently causes early waterproofing failures that require specialized repair."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's different about waterproofing modern homes?",
      "answer": "Modern homes often have complex basement layouts, large windows, walkout areas, and finished spaces that require specialized techniques. We understand current construction methods, materials, and building codes, allowing us to integrate effectively with modern home systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I wait before waterproofing a new home?",
      "answer": "Don't wait if you're experiencing problems. New construction defects should be addressed immediately to prevent damage and support warranty claims. However, we recommend preventive assessment within the first 2-3 years even without obvious problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work with my builder or warranty company?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We frequently work with builders to remedy waterproofing defects and provide documentation supporting warranty claims. Our professional relationships with area builders often facilitate smoother resolution of construction issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about my finished basement in a new home?",
      "answer": "New home finished basements can often be protected with minimal disruption using interior systems. We understand modern finishing materials and can work around contemporary basement designs while providing comprehensive protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle Woodbridge's heavy clay soil?",
      "answer": "We use specialized techniques including enhanced drainage systems, flexible waterproofing materials, and foundation stabilization methods. Our solutions are engineered specifically for clay soil movement patterns common in Vaughan area."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty do you provide for new home waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime transferable warranty fully covers new construction applications. This provides long-term protection beyond builder warranties and adds significant value when selling your home. The warranty adapts to changing conditions as your home settles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate with smart home systems?",
      "answer": "Yes, we can integrate monitoring systems with home automation, provide smartphone alerts for sump pump operation, and coordinate with existing home security and monitoring systems. Modern waterproofing can be part of your smart home ecosystem."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you start work on a new home?",
      "answer": "We prioritize new construction issues because early intervention prevents extensive damage. Depending on scheduling, we can often begin within 1-2 weeks for urgent situations, with emergency service available 24/7 for active water problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer financing for new homeowners?",
      "answer": "Yes, including special programs for recent home purchases. We understand new homeowners have many expenses and offer flexible financing to make proper waterproofing affordable. Some programs include deferred payment options for qualified buyers."
