</figure><h2 id="foundation-problems">Common Foundation Problems in Toronto</h2>
  <p>Toronto's unique soil conditions and climate create specific foundation challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clay Soil Movement</strong> - Toronto's clay soil expands and contracts dramatically with moisture changes, causing foundation movement</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze-Thaw Cycles</strong> - Our harsh winters create repeated freezing and thawing that cracks concrete</li>
    <li><strong>High Water Tables</strong> - Many Toronto neighborhoods have water tables that put constant pressure on foundations</li>
    <li><strong>Age-Related Deterioration</strong> - Many Toronto homes are 50+ years old with foundations needing attention</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="repair-methods">Advanced Foundation Repair Methods</h2>
  
  <h3>Crack Injection Systems</h3>
  <p>For foundation cracks, we use state-of-the-art injection systems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Polyurethane Injection</strong> - Flexible seal for active leaks and moving cracks</li>
    <li><strong>Epoxy Injection</strong> - Structural repair that restores concrete strength</li>
    <li><strong>Crystalline Technology</strong> - Self-healing concrete treatment for hairline cracks</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Structural Reinforcement</h3>
  <p>For more serious structural issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carbon Fiber Straps</strong> - High-strength reinforcement for bowing walls</li>
    <li><strong>Steel I-Beams</strong> - Maximum support for severely compromised walls</li>
    <li><strong>Wall Anchors</strong> - Stabilize and potentially straighten leaning walls</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Foundation Underpinning</h3>
  <p>When foundations need to be strengthened or lowered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mini-Pile System</strong> - Steel piles driven to bedrock for ultimate stability</li>
    <li><strong>Concrete Underpinning</strong> - Traditional method for extending foundation depth</li>
    <li><strong>Resin Injection</strong> - Modern soil stabilization technique</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="cost-factors">Foundation Repair Cost Factors</h2>
  <p>Understanding what affects repair costs helps you budget appropriately:</p>
  
  <div class="cost-factors-list">
    <h3>Primary Cost Factors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Damage Extent</strong> - Minor cracks cost less than major structural issues</li>
      <li><strong>Repair Method</strong> - Simple injections vs. complex underpinning</li>
      <li><strong>Foundation Type</strong> - Block, poured concrete, or stone foundations</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Easy access reduces labor costs</li>
      <li><strong>Soil Conditions</strong> - Challenging soil may require additional work</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permits</strong> - Major repairs require city permits</li>
      <li><strong>Landscaping</strong> - Restoration after exterior work</li>
      <li><strong>Interior Finishing</strong> - Drywall repair after interior work</li>
      <li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> - Often recommended with repairs</li>
    </ul>
