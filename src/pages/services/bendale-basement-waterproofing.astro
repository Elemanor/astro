  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Why do so many Bendale homes have basement water issues?",
      "answer": "Bendale homes are typically 50+ years old with original waterproofing systems now failing. Combined with mature tree roots, mixed soil conditions, and overwhelmed storm sewers, water problems are increasingly common without proper updates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you waterproof without removing mature trees?",
      "answer": "Yes, we specialize in working around Bendale's mature trees. We use root barriers, careful excavation techniques, and alternative drainage routing to protect both your foundation and trees. An arborist consultation may be recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best solution for Bendale's mixed soil?",
      "answer": "Bendale's clay-sand mix requires comprehensive exterior waterproofing for best results. This includes proper membranes, drainage stone selection for mixed soil, and adequate sump pump capacity for varying water flows."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does waterproofing take in Bendale?",
      "answer": "Interior systems typically take 2-3 days. Exterior waterproofing requires 5-10 days depending on tree roots and soil conditions. We provide accurate timelines after inspection and stick to our schedules."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle permits in Scarborough?",
      "answer": "Yes, we manage all City of Toronto permits required for Bendale properties. This includes building permits, tree protection where needed, and any road occupation permits. We know local requirements and inspectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about my finished basement?",
      "answer": "We frequently work with finished basements in Bendale. Interior systems can often be installed with minimal disruption. For exterior work, we document and can assist with restoration of affected areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you price Bendale waterproofing projects?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the solution type, home size, and specific challenges like tree roots. We provide detailed written quotes after inspection. Interior systems range from $3,000-8,000, exterior from $10,000-25,000 typically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is waterproofing worth it for older Bendale homes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Waterproofing protects your investment, prevents costly damage, enables basement use, and is often required for insurance or sale. Many Bendale homeowners see immediate quality of life improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty do you offer in Bendale?",
      "answer": "We provide a fully transferable lifetime warranty on our waterproofing systems. This covers materials and workmanship for as long as you own your home and transfers to new owners - important for resale value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with insurance claims?",
      "answer": "Yes, we work regularly with insurance companies on Bendale water damage claims. We provide detailed documentation, photos, and specifications that insurance adjusters need for approval. We can bill insurance directly."
