  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How do I choose the best basement contractor in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Look for contractors who specialize in basements, have 10+ years experience, carry proper insurance, offer written warranties, and have verifiable references. Ask about their specific experience with your type of project and ensure they pull permits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should basement contractors in Toronto cost?",
      "answer": "Costs vary by project: waterproofing ($3,000-15,000), underpinning ($45,000-70,000), finishing ($50-100/sq ft), crack repair ($500-1,500). Get 3 quotes, but don't choose based on price alone. Quality work costs more but lasts longer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do basement contractors need to be licensed in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Yes, basement contractors need a City of Toronto business license. They should also use licensed electricians and plumbers for those aspects. Always verify licenses and insurance before hiring. Permits are required for most basement work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do basement renovation projects take?",
      "answer": "Timeline depends on scope: waterproofing (3-5 days), underpinning (5-6 weeks), full finishing (6-8 weeks), crack repair (1 day). Weather, permits, and unexpected issues can affect timelines. Get written timeline commitments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranties should basement contractors provide?",
      "answer": "Quality contractors offer: lifetime warranty on waterproofing, 10+ years on structural work, 2+ years on general work. Warranties should be written, transferable, and clear about coverage. Avoid contractors offering no or limited warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can basement contractors help with permits?",
      "answer": "Professional basement contractors should handle all permit applications and inspections. This includes building permits, plumbing permits, and electrical permits as needed. Permit costs are typically additional but the service should be included."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I hire a general contractor or basement specialist?",
      "answer": "Basement specialists are preferred for complex issues like waterproofing, underpinning, or structural repairs. They have specific expertise, equipment, and experience. General contractors work for simple finishing but may lack specialized knowledge."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I expect during a basement contractor consultation?",
      "answer": "Expect thorough inspection (30-60 minutes), detailed questions about issues and goals, explanation of problems found, discussion of solution options, and written quote within 48 hours. Be wary of quick assessments or immediate pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do basement contractors handle unexpected issues?",
      "answer": "Professional contractors anticipate common surprises and include contingencies. When unexpected issues arise, they should: stop work, explain the issue, provide options and costs, get written approval before proceeding, and document everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are basement contractors available for emergencies?",
      "answer": "Quality basement contractors offer 24/7 emergency services for flooding, structural issues, or sewer backups. Response time should be 2-4 hours. Emergency rates may apply, but established clients often get priority service."
