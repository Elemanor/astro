  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the most dangerous type of foundation crack?",
      "answer": "Horizontal cracks are the most dangerous, indicating lateral pressure that exceeds wall strength. Even small horizontal cracks require immediate professional attention as they can lead to wall failure and collapse if left untreated."
    },
    {
      "question": "How wide does a crack need to be before I should worry?",
      "answer": "Width alone doesn't determine severity. Any horizontal crack needs attention regardless of width. For vertical or diagonal cracks, those over 1/8 inch (3mm) wide typically need repair. However, active movement and water infiltration matter more than width."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are vertical cracks in my foundation normal?",
      "answer": "Hairline vertical cracks (less than 1/16 inch) are often normal concrete shrinkage and typically not structural concerns. However, vertical cracks wider than 1/8 inch, showing offset edges, or leaking water need professional assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I tell if a crack is still moving?",
      "answer": "Mark the crack ends with pencil and date them. Check monthly for growth. Install a crack monitor for precise measurement. Fresh concrete edges, clean crack faces, and seasonal width changes all indicate active movement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes horizontal cracks in foundation walls?",
      "answer": "Horizontal cracks result from lateral pressure exceeding wall strength. Common causes include hydrostatic pressure from water-saturated soil, frost pressure from frozen ground, expansive clay soil, poor drainage, and vehicle loads from nearby driveways."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I repair foundation cracks myself?",
      "answer": "Minor vertical hairline cracks can be sealed DIY with hydraulic cement or caulk. However, horizontal cracks, cracks over 1/8 inch wide, active cracks, or any structural concerns require professional repair. Improper repairs can mask serious problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between active and dormant cracks?",
      "answer": "Active cracks are still moving - they change width seasonally, grow longer, or show fresh edges. Dormant cracks are stable with dirt-filled gaps and no changes over time. Active cracks need flexible repairs; dormant can use rigid materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do diagonal cracks appear in foundations?",
      "answer": "Diagonal cracks typically indicate differential settlement - one part of your foundation settling more than another. Causes include uneven soil compression, erosion, drought-induced soil shrinkage, poor compaction during construction, or tree roots extracting moisture."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I call a professional about foundation cracks?",
      "answer": "Call immediately for: any horizontal crack, cracks over 1/4 inch wide, walls bowing inward, active water infiltration, or multiple aligned cracks. Don't wait if you see sudden changes or structural movement - early intervention prevents major damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to repair foundation cracks?",
      "answer": "Costs vary widely: simple crack injection ($300-800), carbon fiber reinforcement ($300-600 per strip), wall anchors ($400-700 each), to major structural repairs or underpinning ($10,000+). Early repair of minor cracks prevents expensive structural work later."
