  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my wall is load bearing?",
      "answer": "Load bearing walls typically run perpendicular to floor joists, sit under walls on the floor above, or support the center of the house. However, only professional assessment can definitively determine if a wall is structural. We provide thorough evaluations before any work begins."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does load bearing wall removal take?",
      "answer": "The actual structural work typically takes 2-3 days. However, the complete project timeline is 2-4 weeks including engineering, permits, and finishing work. Most disruption occurs during the 2-3 day installation period."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit to remove a load bearing wall?",
      "answer": "Yes, removing any load bearing wall requires a building permit in Toronto. This includes engineered drawings and structural calculations. We handle the entire permit process including applications and inspections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I live in my home during the work?",
      "answer": "Yes, most clients stay in their homes. The actual removal and beam installation takes just 2-3 days with temporary supports in place. We maintain safe conditions and clean up daily to minimize disruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between steel and wood beams?",
      "answer": "Steel beams offer maximum strength with minimal size, ideal for long spans and flush ceilings. Engineered wood beams are more economical for moderate spans and easier to work with. We recommend based on your specific loads and preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to remove a load bearing wall?",
      "answer": "Basic 10-12 foot removals typically cost $5,000-10,000 including engineering, permits, beam, and installation. Longer spans or complex projects range $10,500-18,500. Additional costs may include footings, mechanical rerouting, and finishing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will removing a wall damage my home?",
      "answer": "When done properly with engineering and temporary supports, wall removal doesn't damage your home. Poor execution can cause cracks, sagging, and structural failure. Professional installation ensures safety and prevents problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can any load bearing wall be removed?",
      "answer": "Most load bearing walls can be removed with proper beam installation. However, some situations make removal impractical or extremely expensive. Our engineers assess feasibility during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about electrical and plumbing in the wall?",
      "answer": "We coordinate with licensed trades to relocate any utilities in the wall. This includes electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, HVAC ducts, and gas lines. Proper permits cover all work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need posts with the beam?",
      "answer": "Yes, beams require proper support at each end, typically with posts that transfer loads to footings below. We strategically place posts to minimize visual impact while ensuring structural integrity."
