  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the main difference between bench footing and underpinning?",
      "answer": "Underpinning digs under your foundation to maintain full floor space while gaining height. Bench footing creates angled concrete 'benches' along walls, losing significant floor space (typically 30-40% for 2-foot lowering) but costing less upfront."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much space do I lose with bench footing?",
      "answer": "For every foot of lowering, bench footing requires 1.5 feet of horizontal bench width. A 2-foot lowering creates 3-foot wide benches around your entire basement. In a 1,200 sq ft basement, you'd lose about 420 square feet (35%)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is bench footing really cheaper than underpinning?",
      "answer": "Only in upfront costs. Bench footing saves about 25-30% initially, but when you calculate cost per usable square foot, underpinning often costs less. Plus, lost space value can exceed the initial savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I remove bench footing later?",
      "answer": "No. Bench footings are permanent structural elements. Removing them would compromise your foundation stability. The cost to remove and then underpin exceeds original underpinning by 50% or more."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does bench footing make sense?",
      "answer": "Bench footing works for: minor height increases (6-12 inches), utility/storage spaces where center height matters most, extreme budget constraints with no finishing plans, or when engineering specifically requires it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does each method take?",
      "answer": "Industry standard: underpinning takes 8-12 weeks, bench footing 6-8 weeks. However, we complete both methods in under 5 weeks, so there's no time advantage to choosing bench footing with us."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the 45-degree rule?",
      "answer": "Building code requires bench footing angles to follow the 45-degree rule - an imaginary line from your existing footing must pass through the bench at 45 degrees or less. This ensures stability but creates the space-eating angle."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does each method affect home value?",
      "answer": "Underpinning typically adds $100+ per square foot in value. Bench footing adds less due to compromised space. Real estate listings must disclose 'height restrictions' with bench footing, affecting buyer interest."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I finish a bench footed basement?",
      "answer": "Yes, but with limitations. Furniture placement is restricted, room layouts are compromised, and the angled benches remain visible or need creative covering. It never achieves the clean look of an underpinned basement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which method do you recommend?",
      "answer": "In 90% of cases, underpinning is the better investment. It maintains full space, adds more value, and you won't regret it later. We only recommend bench footing for specific situations like minor height needs or severe budget constraints."
