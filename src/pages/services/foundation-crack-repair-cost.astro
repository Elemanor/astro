  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to repair a foundation crack in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Foundation crack repair in Toronto costs $400-1,500 for standard cracks. Hairline cracks cost $400-800, standard cracks (1/8\"-1/4\") cost $600-1,200, and wide cracks cost $800-1,800. Structural repairs requiring reinforcement can reach $2,500-5,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do foundation crack repair costs vary so much?",
      "answer": "Costs vary based on crack type (vertical vs. horizontal), size (hairline to structural), location (accessible vs. hidden), repair method (injection vs. excavation), and urgency. Structural cracks cost more due to reinforcement needs, while simple vertical cracks cost less."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth paying for professional crack repair?",
      "answer": "Yes, professional repair is worth the investment. DIY attempts succeed only 20-30% of the time and last 6-12 months. Professional repairs succeed 95-99% of the time, last 20+ years, include warranties, and prevent thousands in water damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I repair multiple foundation cracks at once for a discount?",
      "answer": "Yes, most contractors offer 10-20% discounts for multiple crack repairs. Bundling repairs saves on setup costs and travel time. Some companies offer package deals like '3 cracks for $2,000' providing additional savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my crack needs expensive structural repair?",
      "answer": "Structural repair is needed for horizontal cracks, cracks wider than 1/2\", cracks with wall movement, or step cracks with displacement. These indicate pressure problems requiring reinforcement beyond simple injection, costing $2,500-5,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in foundation crack repair costs?",
      "answer": "Professional crack repair includes inspection, surface preparation, injection materials (polyurethane or epoxy), labor, cleanup, and warranty. Quality contractors also include follow-up inspections and warranty registration. Ensure quotes detail all components."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is exterior excavation worth the extra cost?",
      "answer": "Exterior excavation ($2,000-3,000) is worth it for repeatedly failing cracks, multiple cracks in one area, or when interior repair isn't possible. Though costly, it provides the most comprehensive solution and often includes drainage improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I finance foundation crack repairs?",
      "answer": "Financing options include 0% interest for 6-12 months, payment plans, home equity loans, and insurance claims for sudden damage. Many contractors offer same-day financing approval. Multiple crack repairs may qualify for better terms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do foundation crack repairs add value to my home?",
      "answer": "Yes, professional foundation repairs add value by preventing water damage, maintaining structural integrity, and providing transferable warranties. Documented repairs can add 5-10% to home value and make properties sell faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly should I repair foundation cracks?",
      "answer": "Repair cracks immediately when actively leaking or showing structural signs. Even dormant cracks should be repaired within 3-6 months as they worsen over time. Delays increase repair costs 20-50% annually and risk extensive damage."
