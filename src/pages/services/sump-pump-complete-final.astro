// All 18 FAQs from the original
const serviceFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What exactly is a sump pump and how does it work?",
    answer: "A sump pump is an automatic water removal device installed in your basement's lowest point (sump pit). When groundwater or surface water enters the pit, a float switch activates the pump motor, which forces water up through discharge pipes and away from your foundation. The system cycles automatically - pumping when water levels rise, shutting off when levels drop. It's your home's first line of defense against basement flooding, operating 24/7 to prevent water damage."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the main types of sump pumps available?",
    answer: "There are four main types - 1) Submersible pumps (most popular) - sit underwater in the pit, quieter and more efficient. 2) Pedestal pumps - motor above water, less expensive but noisier. 3) Battery backup pumps - activate during power outages when flooding risk is highest. 4) Water-powered backup pumps - use city water pressure, no electricity needed. Most Toronto homes benefit from submersible primary pumps with battery backup for complete protection."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if I need a sump pump in my Toronto home?",
    answer: "Key warning signs include - water stains or dampness in basement, musty odors, white chalky deposits (efflorescence) on walls, neighbors having sump pumps, living in high-risk areas (The Beaches, Don Valley, Etobicoke South), planning basement renovations, or insurance requirements. Toronto's clay soil, high water table, and extreme weather make sump pumps essential for most properties. Even minor moisture indicates groundwater pressure that will worsen over time."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does sump pump installation cost in Toronto?",
    answer: "Professional sump pump installation in Toronto ranges from $1,200-$4,500 depending on system complexity. Basic installations start around $1,200, standard systems with battery backup cost $2,800-$3,500, and premium systems for challenging conditions can reach $4,500. We provide transparent, no-surprise pricing with detailed written estimates. Emergency installations cost 20-30% more due to urgency. Financing options available with 0% interest for 12 months."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I really need a battery backup sump pump in Toronto?",
    answer: "Absolutely yes if you have a finished basement or would suffer significant damage from flooding. Toronto's storm patterns often cause power outages exactly when pumps are needed most. Ice storms, summer thunderstorms, and grid overload during peak demand create power failures during flooding events. Battery backup systems automatically activate during outages, providing 4-8 hours of pumping capacity. Many Toronto insurance companies now require backup systems for basement coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "What maintenance does a sump pump need?",
    answer: "Sump pumps need monthly testing during wet seasons and annual professional maintenance. Monthly - pour water in pit to test operation, check discharge flow, verify backup battery status. Annual professional service includes pump cleaning, float switch testing, check valve inspection, battery replacement, and discharge line verification. Our maintenance customers experience 90% fewer emergency failures and their pumps last 40% longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I install a sump pump myself or do I need a professional?",
    answer: "While DIY installation is possible, 90% of sump pump failures result from improper installation. Professional installation ensures correct pump sizing, optimal pit placement, code-compliant electrical work, and proper discharge routing. Toronto building codes require permits for most installations. Our licensed technicians guarantee proper installation with lifetime warranty on workmanship. DIY mistakes often cost more to fix than professional installation would have cost initially."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do sump pumps last in Toronto's climate?",
    answer: "Quality sump pumps last 7-10 years with proper maintenance in Toronto's freeze-thaw climate. Premium cast iron pumps can last 10-15 years. Cheaper pumps typically fail in 3-5 years. Toronto's clay soil and seasonal water variations affect pump lifespan - pumps that run constantly wear faster. Our maintenance program extends pump life by 40% through preventive care and early problem detection."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during a sump pump inspection?",
    answer: "Our comprehensive sump pump inspection includes - visual examination of pump and pit condition, float switch operation testing, check valve functionality verification, discharge line flow measurement, electrical connection safety check, battery backup system testing (if present), water volume capacity assessment, and maintenance recommendations. We provide written reports with photos documenting any issues found. Inspections take 30-45 minutes and include free estimates for any needed repairs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a sump pump handle sewage backup?",
    answer: "No, standard sump pumps are designed only for groundwater and cannot handle sewage. Sewage contains solids and bacteria that will damage regular pumps and create health hazards. For sewage backup protection, you need a separate sewage ejector pump or backwater valve installation. Many Toronto homes need both systems - sump pumps for groundwater and backwater valves for sewage protection. We install both systems and can assess your specific needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Where does sump pump water discharge go?",
    answer: "In Toronto, sump pump discharge must follow strict municipal bylaws. Water typically discharges to - your property's surface (lawn or garden) at least 6 feet from foundation, storm sewer connections (where permitted with proper permits), or drainage swales leading away from your home. Discharge to sanitary sewers is illegal and subject to heavy fines. We ensure your installation meets all City of Toronto requirements and obtain necessary permits."
  },
  {
    question: "How loud are sump pumps when running?",
    answer: "Noise levels vary by pump type. Submersible pumps are quietest (40-50 decibels, like a quiet library) because water muffles motor noise. Pedestal pumps are louder (60-70 decibels, like normal conversation) since the motor sits above water. Quality pumps with proper installation minimize vibration noise. Battery backup pumps may be slightly louder but only run during emergencies. We recommend submersible pumps for finished basements where noise matters."
  },
  {
    question: "What size sump pump do I need for my Toronto home?",
    answer: "Pump sizing depends on multiple factors including basement size, water table depth, soil type, drainage area, and historical water volume. Most Toronto homes need 1/3 HP pumps (2,200-2,500 GPH capacity) for average conditions. Larger homes or high water tables may require 1/2 HP pumps (3,000-4,000 GPH). We never guess - our free assessment includes precise calculations to ensure your pump handles peak water flow with 25% safety margin."
  },
  {
    question: "Do sump pumps increase home value?",
    answer: "Yes, professionally installed sump pumps increase Toronto home values by protecting against water damage and demonstrating proactive maintenance. Real estate data shows homes with sump pumps sell faster and for 2-5% more than comparable homes without. Buyers especially value battery backup systems and maintenance records. Many buyers now require sump pump installation as a condition of sale. The investment pays for itself through increased value and insurance savings."
  },
  {
    question: "What are signs my sump pump is failing?",
    answer: "Warning signs of sump pump failure include - pump running constantly without moving water, unusual noises (grinding, rattling, or gurgling), visible rust or corrosion on pump housing, pump not activating when water enters pit, reduced water flow from discharge pipe, frequent cycling on and off, pump age exceeding 7 years, or electrical burning smell. Any of these signs require immediate professional inspection to prevent flooding. We offer free emergency assessments."
  },
  {
    question: "Does homeowner's insurance cover sump pump installation?",
    answer: "Most insurance policies don't cover sump pump installation costs, but having one can significantly reduce premiums and ensure flood damage coverage. Many Toronto insurers now offer 5-15% discounts for homes with professionally installed sump pumps, especially with battery backup. Some policies require sump pumps for basement coverage. We provide installation certificates and documentation needed for insurance claims. Check your specific policy or contact your broker for details."
  },
  {
    question: "Can sump pumps prevent mold growth?",
    answer: "Yes, sump pumps are crucial for mold prevention by eliminating the moisture mold needs to grow. By removing water before it enters your basement, sump pumps maintain humidity below 50% - the threshold for mold growth. This prevents the musty odors, health issues, and expensive remediation associated with mold. Combined with proper ventilation and dehumidification, sump pumps create an environment where mold cannot thrive, protecting your family's health and home value."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your sump pump warranty?",
    answer: "Our comprehensive warranty package includes - lifetime warranty on all installation workmanship (transferable to new owners), 10-year warranty on premium pump components, 5-year warranty on battery backup systems, 2-year warranty on electrical components, free first-year maintenance check, and 24/7 emergency support. Warranty covers all defects in materials and workmanship. Regular maintenance keeps warranty valid. We handle all warranty claims directly - no dealing with manufacturers."
