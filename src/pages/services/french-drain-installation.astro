  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What is a French drain and how does it work?",
      "answer": "A French drain is a gravel-filled trench with a perforated pipe that redirects water away from your foundation. Interior French drains collect water from around your foundation walls and direct it to a sump pump system. Exterior French drains intercept groundwater before it reaches your foundation. The system works by gravity and creates a path of least resistance for water flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Interior vs exterior French drain - which is better?",
      "answer": "Both have advantages: Interior French drains cost less ($8K-12K vs $15K-25K), work year-round, and don't require landscaping restoration. Exterior systems provide comprehensive foundation protection and address the water source directly. Many Toronto homes benefit from a combination approach. Our assessment determines the best solution for your specific water issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does French drain installation cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Interior French drain systems range from $8,000-12,000 for typical Toronto basements. Exterior systems cost $15,000-25,000 due to excavation requirements. Factors affecting cost include: basement perimeter length, soil conditions, access limitations, and complexity of existing utilities. We provide detailed quotes with no hidden fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does French drain installation take?",
      "answer": "Interior French drain installation typically takes 3-5 days for most Toronto basements. Exterior systems require 5-7 days due to excavation and backfill work. Timeline factors include weather conditions, soil type, access restrictions, and permit requirements. We provide detailed schedules and minimize disruption to your daily routine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for French drain installation?",
      "answer": "Interior French drains typically don't require permits in Toronto, but exterior systems may need permits for excavation near property lines. Sump pump discharge connections to storm sewers require City approval. We handle all permit applications and ensure compliance with Toronto bylaws and Ontario Building Code requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a French drain solve my basement flooding?",
      "answer": "French drains are highly effective for most basement water issues, especially those caused by hydrostatic pressure and poor drainage. However, some situations may require additional solutions like crack repair, exterior waterproofing, or improved surface drainage. Our comprehensive assessment identifies all water sources and recommends the most effective solution."

          in just four days. Two years later, through Toronto's wettest spring on record, our basement stayed completely dry. 
          Best money we ever spent!"

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="How long do French drains last?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Properly installed French drains last 25-50+ years. Our systems use high-quality perforated pipe, proper grading, and filter fabric to prevent clogging. Regular maintenance extends system life indefinitely.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Will French drains work in winter?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Interior French drains work year-round since they're below the frost line. Exterior systems may experience reduced flow during extreme cold but resume full operation during thaws.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Can French drains handle heavy rainfall?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Yes, our systems are designed for Toronto's extreme weather events. We size pipes and sump pumps to handle 100-year storm events, ensuring protection during the heaviest rainfall.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Do French drains require maintenance?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Minimal maintenance is required. Annual sump pump testing, cleaning inlet screens, and periodic drain cleaning maintain optimal performance. We provide maintenance guides and annual service options.</p>
