  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Can you waterproof without damaging heritage features?",
      "answer": "Yes, we specialize in heritage properties. Our interior waterproofing systems protect foundations without affecting exterior appearance. When exterior work is needed, we use reversible methods that preserve historical materials and details."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do stone foundations need different waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Stone foundations require breathable solutions that allow moisture vapor to escape while preventing liquid water entry. We use specialized mortars, appropriate sealers, and systems designed specifically for historical masonry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about heritage permit requirements?",
      "answer": "We handle all heritage permit applications for Annex properties. Our team knows the Heritage Preservation Services requirements and has established relationships with heritage planners for smooth approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is underpinning possible in heritage homes?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly underpin Annex homes to create usable basements. Our hand-excavation methods and engineered support systems protect historical structures while achieving modern ceiling heights. All work meets heritage standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle shared walls in semi-detached homes?",
      "answer": "Party wall agreements are essential. We coordinate with neighbors, arrange engineering inspections, and often implement joint solutions that benefit both properties. Our experience with Annex semis ensures smooth projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost for heritage home waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Costs vary based on foundation type and solution chosen. Interior systems typically range from $5,000-12,000. Underpinning projects start around $40,000. We provide detailed quotes after inspection and offer financing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can waterproofing increase my Annex home's value?",
      "answer": "Significantly. Dry, usable basements add substantial value in The Annex. Proper waterproofing enables legal basement apartments, home theatres, or additional living space - features buyers expect in this premium market."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does work take in The Annex?",
      "answer": "Interior waterproofing typically takes 3-5 days. Underpinning projects require 6-8 weeks. We understand Annex owners' high standards and maintain clean, organized sites throughout the project duration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with the universities and colleges nearby?",
      "answer": "Yes, we coordinate with U of T and other institutions when working near campus. We understand academic schedules, exam periods, and special event considerations. Many professors and staff are our clients."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty applies to heritage properties?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime transferable warranty fully covers heritage homes. We guarantee our systems will keep your basement dry while respecting historical integrity. Documentation provided supports heritage tax credits and resale."
