Interior waterproofing ranges $3,500-$8,500, exterior systems cost $4,500-$12,000 depending on foundation complexity and area. Downtown commands premium pricing due to access challenges, suburban areas offer competitive rates. Complex foundation repairs increase costs significantly.</p>

<p>### How long does basement waterproofing take?
Interior waterproofing takes 3-5 days, exterior systems require 5-10 days depending on weather and complexity. Local contractors often work faster due to material proximity, familiar soil conditions, and established local processes and supplier relationships.</p>

<p>### Do I need permits for basement waterproofing?
Exterior waterproofing typically requires building permits in Toronto municipalities. Interior waterproofing may need electrical permits for sump pump connections. Professional local contractors handle all permits, inspections, and compliance requirements.</p>
