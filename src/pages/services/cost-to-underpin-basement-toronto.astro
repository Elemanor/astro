  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the average cost to underpin a basement in Toronto?",
      "answer": "The average cost to underpin a basement in Toronto is $49,000-70,000 for a typical 30x40 foot home (140 linear feet). This works out to $350-500 per linear foot and includes all excavation, underpinning, waterproofing, and a new concrete floor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does underpinning cost vary so much?",
      "answer": "Underpinning costs vary based on soil conditions (rock adds $100-200/linear foot), access restrictions (limited access adds 20-30%), foundation type (stone foundations cost 15-20% more), depth requirements, and seasonal factors. Get a detailed quote for accurate pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in underpinning cost estimates?",
      "answer": "Professional underpinning quotes include: engineering and permits ($3,000-5,000), excavation and disposal, structural underpinning work, waterproofing and drainage, new concrete floor with vapor barrier, basic utility relocations, and warranty. Finishing work is additional."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I finance basement underpinning?",
      "answer": "Most homeowners use home equity lines of credit (HELOC) with interest-only payments during construction. Other options include refinancing to access equity, construction loans, or payment plans. Rental income often covers loan payments making it cash-flow positive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is underpinning worth the cost?",
      "answer": "Yes, underpinning typically provides 200-300% ROI. Creating 1,200 sq ft of space worth $200-400/sq ft adds $240,000-480,000 in value for a $60,000 investment. Plus rental income of $2,500-3,500/month provides ongoing returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are underpinning estimates?",
      "answer": "Professional estimates are typically accurate within 10% for standard conditions. Unexpected issues like rock, old foundations, or buried obstacles can add costs. Reputable contractors include contingencies and discuss potential extras upfront."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I reduce underpinning costs?",
      "answer": "While you can't compromise structural work, you can reduce overall project costs by: doing your own finishing work later, choosing basic waterproofing over premium, scheduling during slower seasons, or considering bench footing (though this loses space)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do underpinning costs include permits?",
      "answer": "Quality contractors include permit costs ($1,500-3,000) in their quotes. This covers building permits, engineer reviews, and required inspections. Be wary of quotes that exclude permits as this indicates corners may be cut."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much extra for a walkout basement?",
      "answer": "Adding a walkout entrance during underpinning costs an additional $15,000-25,000. This includes excavation, retaining walls, stairs, doors, and drainage. It's most cost-effective when done with underpinning rather than later."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hidden costs should I watch for?",
      "answer": "Potential additional costs include: rock removal ($100-200/linear foot), high water table pumping ($5,000-10,000), contaminated soil disposal, party wall agreements ($2,000-3,000), and engineering changes. Discuss these possibilities upfront."
