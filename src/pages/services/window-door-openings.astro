  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit to cut windows or doors in my foundation?",
      "answer": "Yes, all foundation openings require building permits in Toronto. This includes structural drawings and often engineer stamps. We handle the complete permit process for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to cut a window opening?",
      "answer": "Most window openings complete within 3-5 days. This includes cutting, structural installation, waterproofing, and basic finishing. Door openings may take 5-7 days due to larger size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will cutting openings crack my foundation?",
      "answer": "When done properly with correct engineering and techniques, new openings won't cause cracks. We use controlled cutting methods and proper reinforcement to maintain structural integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum size for an egress window?",
      "answer": "Egress windows must have minimum 3.8 sq ft opening area, with no dimension less than 15 inches. The sill must be maximum 39 inches above the floor. We ensure full code compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you cut openings in winter?",
      "answer": "Yes, we can cut openings year-round. Winter work requires heated enclosures for concrete work and proper curing. Some exterior finishing may need to wait for warmer weather."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does an egress window cost?",
      "answer": "Basic egress window cutting starts around $2,000-3,000. With window well, expect $3,500-5,000. Including the window itself, total costs typically range $4,000-6,000 depending on complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do new openings need waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Every opening requires comprehensive waterproofing including membranes, proper drainage, and integration with existing systems. Poor waterproofing turns openings into leak points."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add a door to create a basement apartment?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly create separate entrances for legal basement apartments. This includes proper-sized openings, code-compliant stairs, adequate landings, and required permits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if there are utilities where I want the opening?",
      "answer": "We always verify utility locations before cutting. If utilities are present, they can usually be relocated. We coordinate with appropriate trades to ensure safe relocation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will window wells fill with water?",
      "answer": "Properly constructed window wells include drainage to weeping tile or storm systems. We ensure positive drainage and can add covers for extra protection. Wells shouldn't hold water."
