  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How much does basement lowering cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Basement lowering costs $30,000-70,000 depending on method. Underpinning (maintaining full floor space) costs $45,000-70,000 for a typical home. Bench footing (losing perimeter space) costs $30,000-45,000. Price includes excavation, structural work, waterproofing, and new concrete floor."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does basement lowering take?",
      "answer": "Basement lowering typically takes 5-6 weeks from start to finish. This includes 1 week preparation, 2-3 weeks structural work, 1 week interior excavation, and 1 week finishing. You can usually stay in your home throughout, though expect noise during work hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I lower my basement without underpinning?",
      "answer": "Yes, bench footing is an alternative that creates an angled bench along walls instead of digging under foundations. It's cheaper but loses 30-40% of floor space. Most homeowners prefer underpinning for full space retention, but benching works for tight budgets."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much height can I gain lowering my basement?",
      "answer": "Most basement lowering projects gain 2-3 feet of height. If your current ceiling is 6 feet, expect 8-9 feet after lowering. The amount depends on soil conditions, existing foundation depth, and local frost line requirements. We determine exact possibilities during inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is basement lowering worth it in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Yes, basement lowering typically provides 200-300% ROI in Toronto. Creating 1,000 sq ft of legal living space worth $200-400/sq ft adds $200,000-400,000 in value. Plus, rental income potential of $2,000-3,000/month provides ongoing returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for basement lowering?",
      "answer": "Yes, basement lowering requires building permits including structural, plumbing, and electrical permits as applicable. You'll need engineered drawings and multiple inspections. We handle all permit applications and coordinate inspections as part of our service."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can any basement be lowered?",
      "answer": "Most basements can be lowered, but factors affecting feasibility include foundation type, soil conditions, water table depth, and neighboring structures. Stone or rubble foundations need special techniques. Very high water tables may require extensive drainage. Professional assessment determines your options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will basement lowering damage my house?",
      "answer": "No, properly executed basement lowering is safe. The underpinning process maintains continuous support using engineered sequencing. Minor settlement (1-2mm) is normal and monitored throughout. Thousands of Toronto homes have been successfully lowered without damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in basement lowering?",
      "answer": "Complete basement lowering includes: excavation and soil removal, underpinning or benching, waterproofing systems, drainage installation, vapor barriers, new concrete floor, basic utility relocations, permits and inspections. Finishing work like framing and drywall is separate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I create a legal basement apartment?",
      "answer": "Yes, basement lowering is often the first step to creating legal apartments. You'll achieve required 6'5\" ceiling height. Additional requirements include separate entrance, proper windows, fire separation, and sound insulation. We ensure structural work supports apartment conversion."
