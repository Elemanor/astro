  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What concrete strength (MPa) is required for underpinning?",
      "answer": "32 MPa is the recommended minimum strength for underpinning concrete. This provides adequate load-bearing capacity for your entire house, resistance to freeze-thaw cycles, and includes a safety factor. While 25 MPa may meet minimum code, 32 MPa ensures long-term durability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is slump and why does it matter for foundation concrete?",
      "answer": "Slump measures concrete workability - how much it settles when tested. For underpinning footings, 75-100mm slump is ideal. Higher slump means more water, which weakens concrete. Never exceed 150mm slump or allow water to be added on-site."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is the water-cement ratio in concrete?",
      "answer": "Water-cement ratio is critical - it directly determines final strength. For 32 MPa concrete, maintain 0.45 maximum ratio. More water creates weaker concrete. Each 0.05 increase in ratio can reduce strength by 5 MPa. Never let contractors add water on-site."
    },
    {
      "question": "What testing should be done on underpinning concrete?",
      "answer": "Essential tests include: slump test on every truck, air content testing (5-8% for Toronto), and cylinder tests (minimum 3 cylinders per pour, tested at 7 and 28 days). Testing costs about $300-500 total but prevents potential $20,000+ failures."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does concrete take to reach full strength?",
      "answer": "Concrete reaches full design strength at 28 days, but gains strength over time: 40% at 3 days, 65% at 7 days, 90% at 14 days, and 100% at 28 days. Proper curing during the first 7 days is critical for achieving design strength."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the proper curing method for underpinning concrete?",
      "answer": "Keep concrete moist and temperature-controlled for minimum 7 days. Use wet burlap, plastic sheeting, or curing compounds. Maintain temperature above 10°C. Poor curing can reduce strength by 50%. Footings need 7-day moist cure minimum."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can underpinning concrete be poured in winter?",
      "answer": "Yes, with precautions: heated concrete mix, insulated forms, temporary heat for 3+ days, maintain 10°C minimum, and use accelerators if needed. Winter pours cost more but are safe when done properly. Never pour on frozen ground."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do contractors resist concrete testing?",
      "answer": "Some contractors resist because testing reveals problems, costs time, and requires accountability. Testing might reject loads they'd otherwise use. Good contractors include testing as standard practice. If your contractor resists testing, find another contractor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if water is added to concrete on site?",
      "answer": "Adding water increases slump and water-cement ratio, dramatically reducing strength. Each gallon added can reduce strength by 5%. A 32 MPa mix can become 20 MPa with excess water. Never allow on-site water addition - use plasticizers instead."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much more does 32 MPa cost versus 25 MPa concrete?",
      "answer": "The difference is typically $10-15 per cubic meter, or $200-400 for an entire underpinning project - about 2-3% more. This minimal extra cost provides 28% more strength, better durability, and peace of mind. The value far exceeds the cost."
