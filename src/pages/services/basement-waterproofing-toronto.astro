    {
      question: "What makes basement waterproofing in Toronto different from other cities?",
      answer: "Toronto's unique challenges include 122 days of annual precipitation, expansive clay soil that moves with seasons, aging infrastructure (many homes 50+ years old), extreme freeze-thaw cycles, and high water table in many neighborhoods. Our Toronto-specific solutions address these exact conditions with proven materials and techniques developed over 15+ years of local experience."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does basement waterproofing cost in Toronto?",
      answer: "Toronto basement waterproofing costs vary by neighborhood and home type: Downtown/Central ($6,500-$15,000), North Toronto ($4,500-$12,000), East Toronto ($4,000-$11,000), West Toronto ($4,200-$11,500). Factors include foundation age, soil conditions, access challenges, and required permits. We provide detailed written estimates with no hidden fees."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work during Toronto winters?",
      answer: "Yes! Interior waterproofing works year-round regardless of weather. Exterior waterproofing can be done in winter using heated enclosures and winter-grade materials. We provide 24/7 emergency service regardless of weather conditions, with permanent solutions scheduled for optimal conditions."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle Toronto building permits?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We handle all permit applications with the City of Toronto, including building permits for excavation, electrical permits for sump pumps, and plumbing permits for drainage. Our established relationships with Toronto building departments ensure smooth processing and faster project starts."

          <p>Local Toronto contractors offer superior value: faster response times, intimate knowledge of Toronto soil and climate conditions, established relationships with City of Toronto, community accountability, no travel charges, and ongoing local presence for warranty service.</p>
