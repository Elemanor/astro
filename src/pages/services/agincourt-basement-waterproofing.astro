  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Why do so many Agincourt homes have water problems?",
      "answer": "Agincourt's clay soil, aging infrastructure, and increased development create perfect conditions for water issues. Homes built in the 1960s-1980s often have deteriorating waterproofing, while the area's storm systems struggle with modern rainfall levels."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best waterproofing solution for Agincourt homes?",
      "answer": "It depends on your specific situation. Interior systems work well for finished basements and managing seasonal water. Exterior waterproofing provides comprehensive protection for severe issues. Many Agincourt homes benefit from combined approaches due to clay soil challenges."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does waterproofing take in Agincourt?",
      "answer": "Interior waterproofing typically takes 2-3 days. Exterior projects require 5-7 days depending on home size and soil conditions. Agincourt's clay soil may require additional excavation time. We provide detailed timelines during inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle permits for Agincourt projects?",
      "answer": "Yes, we manage all permits required by the City of Toronto for Agincourt properties. This includes building permits for structural work and any street occupation permits needed. Our team knows local requirements and inspector preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about my finished basement?",
      "answer": "We specialize in protecting finished basements. Interior waterproofing can often be installed with minimal disruption to finishing. For exterior work, we carefully remove and can reinstall sections as needed. Many Agincourt clients waterproof without major renovation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle Agincourt's clay soil?",
      "answer": "We use specialized techniques for clay soil including proper drainage stone selection, enhanced membrane systems, and flexible sealants that accommodate movement. Our systems are designed specifically for clay soil expansion and contraction cycles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty coverage do you provide?",
      "answer": "We offer a lifetime transferable warranty on our waterproofing systems. This covers materials and workmanship for as long as you own your home and transfers to new owners. Essential for Agincourt's real estate market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work around mature trees?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Agincourt properties have beautiful mature trees. We use specialized excavation techniques, hand digging when necessary, and root protection systems. We've successfully waterproofed hundreds of homes while preserving landscaping."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer financing for Agincourt homeowners?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer flexible financing options including 0% interest programs for qualified homeowners. We understand waterproofing is a significant investment and work to make it affordable. Many Agincourt clients use our financing options."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies?",
      "answer": "We maintain 24/7 emergency service for Agincourt with typical response times of 2-4 hours. Our team knows the area well and keeps emergency supplies stocked. Past clients receive priority emergency response."

          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Agincourt sits on clay soil that expands when wet, creating pressure against foundations. Many homes were built in the 1950s-1970s with basic drainage systems that can't handle today's weather patterns. The mature neighborhood has established trees whose roots can also affect drainage.</p>

          <p>Costs vary based on your home's specific needs, but typical Agincourt waterproofing ranges from $8,000-15,000. Clay soil conditions may require specialized approaches. We provide detailed quotes and work with local homeowners to find affordable solutions.</p>
