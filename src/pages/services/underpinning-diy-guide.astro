  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "Can I legally underpin my own house in Toronto?",
      "answer": "While not explicitly illegal for homeowners, you MUST obtain permits, hire a structural engineer, and pass multiple inspections. The engineering alone costs $5,000-10,000. Without proper permits and engineering, it's illegal and your insurance is void."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much would DIY underpinning actually save?",
      "answer": "Nothing. Professional underpinning costs about $40,000. DIY costs include: engineering ($5,000-10,000), permits ($2,000-5,000), equipment rental ($20,000+), materials ($10,000+), and disposal ($5,000+). Total: $35,000-50,000, with catastrophic risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my DIY underpinning fails?",
      "answer": "Consequences include: house collapse (partial or total), insurance claim denial, criminal charges if anyone is injured, lawsuits from damage, mortgage called due, property becomes unsaleable, and potential bankruptcy. The city can also condemn your home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the 3-4 foot excavation rule so important?",
      "answer": "Excavating more than 3-4 feet at once removes too much support, risking immediate collapse. Your house weighs 100+ tons - that weight must be continuously supported. Professional contractors never exceed this limit and never excavate adjacent sections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I hire day laborers to help with underpinning?",
      "answer": "This dramatically increases liability. If someone is injured or killed, you face criminal charges and lawsuits. Professional contractors carry $5 million insurance and worker's compensation. One injury could cost you everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "What engineering is actually required for underpinning?",
      "answer": "Required engineering includes: load calculations, soil analysis, excavation sequencing, shoring design, footing specifications, reinforcement schedules, and monitoring protocols. This requires a structural engineer, costing $5,000-10,000 minimum."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't I just dig carefully and pour concrete?",
      "answer": "Underpinning isn't just digging and pouring. It requires: sequential excavation planning, continuous load support, engineered concrete mix, proper reinforcement, structural connections, waterproofing integration, and precise backfilling. One mistake causes catastrophic failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What special equipment do professionals use?",
      "answer": "Professionals use: engineered shoring systems, hydraulic jacks, laser monitoring equipment, concrete pumps, compaction equipment, and specialized excavation tools. Renting this equipment costs $20,000+ and requires training to operate safely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is underpinning covered by homeowner's insurance?",
      "answer": "Insurance specifically excludes earth movement and foundation work. If your DIY underpinning fails, insurance won't cover the damage. Worse, attempting it yourself may void your entire policy, leaving you completely unprotected."
    },
    {
      "question": "After reading this, should I attempt DIY underpinning?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. This guide exists to show why underpinning requires professionals. The cost savings are minimal to negative, while risks include total home loss, criminal charges, and bankruptcy. Hire insured professionals with experience and proper equipment."
