  <h2 id="foundation-problems">Common Foundation Problems in Toronto</h2>
  <p>Toronto's unique soil conditions and climate create specific foundation challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Settling and Sinking</strong> - Clay soil expands and contracts with moisture changes</li>
    <li><strong>Foundation Cracks</strong> - Freeze-thaw cycles cause concrete to crack</li>
    <li><strong>Water Damage</strong> - High water tables lead to hydrostatic pressure</li>
    <li><strong>Structural Movement</strong> - Age and environmental factors cause shifting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="repair-methods">Foundation Repair Methods We Use</h2>
  <h3>Crack Injection</h3>
  <p>For minor to moderate cracks, we use polyurethane or epoxy injection to seal and strengthen the concrete.</p>

  <h3>Underpinning</h3>
  <p>For serious structural issues, underpinning extends the foundation depth to more stable soil layers.</p>

  <h3>Wall Anchors</h3>
  <p>Bowing or leaning walls can be stabilized with our wall anchor systems.</p>

  <h3>Drainage Solutions</h3>
  <p>Many foundation problems stem from water issues. We install proper drainage to protect your foundation.</p>

  <h2 id="cost-factors">Factors Affecting Foundation Repair Costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extent of Damage</strong> - More extensive damage requires more comprehensive repairs</li>
    <li><strong>Repair Method</strong> - Different techniques have varying costs</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Hard-to-reach areas may increase labor costs</li>
    <li><strong>Soil Conditions</strong> - Challenging soil may require additional stabilization</li>
    <li><strong>Permit Requirements</strong> - Some repairs require municipal permits</li>
