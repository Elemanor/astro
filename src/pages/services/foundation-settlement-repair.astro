  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      question: "How much does foundation settlement repair cost in Toronto?",
      answer: "Foundation settlement repair in Toronto typically costs $8,000-$30,000 for residential properties, depending on severity and chosen solution. Push pier systems average $1,500-$2,500 per pier installed, with most homes requiring 6-12 piers. Complete projects including lifting typically run: minor settlement (5-8 piers) $8,000-$15,000, moderate settlement (10-15 piers) $15,000-$30,000, severe settlement (20+ piers) $30,000-$50,000. Additional costs may include engineering assessments ($1,500-$3,000), permits ($500-$1,500), and interior repairs ($2,000-$10,000)."
    },
    {
      question: "What are signs my foundation is settling?",
      answer: "Foundation settlement manifests through multiple warning signs that worsen progressively. Early indicators include doors and windows that stick or won't latch properly, hairline cracks at wall-ceiling joints, and slight floor slopes. As settlement progresses, you'll notice diagonal cracks running from door and window corners, gaps between floors and walls, and visible floor slopes exceeding 1/2 inch over 10 feet. Severe settlement signs demand immediate attention: stair-step cracks in brick or block walls, chimneys leaning or separating from the house, and plumbing issues from pipe stress."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does foundation settlement repair take?",
      answer: "Most residential foundation settlement repairs complete within 2-5 days, though project complexity affects timeline. Push pier installation typically progresses at 3-4 piers daily, so a 12-pier project takes 3-4 days. Day one involves excavation and bracket attachment, days 2-3 pier driving and lifting operations, and final day includes backfilling and cleanup. Helical piers install faster at 4-6 daily, reducing project duration. Pre-construction engineering and permits add 1-2 weeks before work begins."
    },
    {
      question: "Is foundation settlement covered by insurance?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance typically excludes gradual foundation settlement, considering it maintenance-related or earth movement. However, coverage often exists for sudden settlement from covered perils like plumbing leaks, or consequential damage from settlement such as broken pipes or damaged finishes. We help document conditions to maximize eligible claims. Some insurers offer special riders for foundation coverage, though these are rare and expensive in Toronto due to our clay soils."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you lift my foundation back to level?",
      answer: "Yes, in most cases we can lift settled foundations back to their original position. Our hydraulic lifting process is carefully controlled - we monitor movement in real-time using laser levels to ensure uniform lifting. The amount of lift possible depends on factors like settlement severity, structure flexibility, and interior finishes. We typically achieve 75-100% correction, closing cracks and realigning doors/windows. Some limitations exist with brittle finishes or extreme settlement."

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        Toronto sits on expansive clay soils that create unique foundation challenges. During dry summers, 
        clay shrinks dramatically - we've measured volume reductions up to 15% in Scarborough and North York 
        properties. When fall rains arrive, the clay expands, but never uniformly. This constant shrink-swell 
        cycle causes differential settlement, where one part of your foundation moves while another stays put.

        <p>What begins as doors that stick ($200 adjustment) progresses to diagonal wall cracks ($2,000 repairs), 
        then structural damage ($15,000+), and eventually complete foundation failure requiring $60,000-$100,000 
        rebuilding. Early intervention with engineered pier systems costs just $8,000-$20,000 and stops 
        settlement permanently.</p>
