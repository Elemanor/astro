  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How much does foundation settlement repair cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Foundation settlement repair in Toronto typically costs $8,000-$30,000 for residential properties, depending on severity and chosen solution. Push pier systems average $1,500-$2,500 per pier installed, with most homes requiring 6-12 piers. Helical piers cost slightly less at $1,200-$2,000 per pier. Complete projects including lifting typically run: minor settlement (5-8 piers) $8,000-$15,000, moderate settlement (10-15 piers) $15,000-$30,000, severe settlement (20+ piers) $30,000-$50,000.\n\nAdditional costs may include engineering assessments ($1,500-$3,000), permits ($500-$1,500), and interior repairs ($2,000-$10,000). However, these investments prevent far greater losses. Unaddressed settlement can cause $50,000+ in structural damage, plumbing failures costing $10,000+, and property devaluation of $75,000-$150,000. We offer flexible financing and assist with insurance claims where applicable.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are signs my foundation is settling?",
      "answer": "Foundation settlement manifests through multiple warning signs that worsen progressively. Early indicators include doors and windows that stick or won't latch properly, hairline cracks at wall-ceiling joints, and slight floor slopes. As settlement progresses, you'll notice diagonal cracks running from door and window corners, gaps between floors and walls, and visible floor slopes exceeding 1/2 inch over 10 feet.\n\nSevere settlement signs demand immediate attention: stair-step cracks in brick or block walls, chimneys leaning or separating from the house, wall-ceiling separation exceeding 1/4 inch, and plumbing issues from pipe stress. Exterior signs include foundation cracks visible from outside, porch or stoop pulling away, and concrete slabs cracking near the foundation. If you observe multiple signs or rapid progression, professional assessment is critical - settlement accelerates once movement begins.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does foundation settlement repair take?",
      "answer": "Most residential foundation settlement repairs complete within 2-5 days, though project complexity affects timeline. Push pier installation typically progresses at 3-4 piers daily, so a 12-pier project takes 3-4 days. Day one involves excavation and bracket attachment, days 2-3 pier driving and lifting operations, and final day includes backfilling and cleanup. Helical piers install faster at 4-6 daily, reducing project duration.\n\nPre-construction engineering and permits add 1-2 weeks before work begins. Interior repairs, if needed, extend timeline another 3-5 days. Weather rarely delays our work - we install piers year-round using specialized equipment. Critical factors affecting duration include access restrictions (tight spaces slow installation), lifting requirements (adds precision time), and number of piers. We provide detailed schedules and maintain consistent communication throughout projects.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is foundation settlement covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Standard homeowner's insurance typically excludes gradual foundation settlement, considering it maintenance-related or earth movement. However, coverage often exists for sudden settlement from covered perils like plumbing leaks, or consequential damage from settlement such as broken pipes or damaged finishes. We help document conditions to maximize eligible claims.\n\nSome insurers offer special riders for foundation coverage, though these are rare and expensive in Toronto due to our clay soils. More valuable is documenting that professional repairs prevent future claims - insurers recognize that stabilized foundations reduce risk of water damage, structural collapse, and liability issues. We provide comprehensive documentation including engineering reports, warranties, and compliance certificates that satisfy insurance requirements and can actually reduce premiums by demonstrating proactive risk mitigation.\n"

</figure><h2 id="what-causes-foundation-settlement">What Causes Foundation Settlement?</h2>
### Soil Problems (Most Common in Toronto)
<ul><li><strong>Clay Shrinkage</strong>: Drought causing soil contraction</li>
<li><strong>Poor Compaction</strong>: Inadequate preparation during construction</li>
<li><strong>Erosion</strong>: Water washing away supporting soil</li>
<li><strong>Tree Roots</strong>: Large trees removing moisture</li>
<li><strong>Organic Decay</strong>: Buried materials decomposing</li>

</ul>### Water Issues
<ul><li><strong>Poor Drainage</strong>: Excess water softening soil</li>
<li><strong>Plumbing Leaks</strong>: Underground pipe failures</li>
<li><strong>Improper Grading</strong>: Water flowing toward foundation</li>
<li><strong>Missing Gutters</strong>: Roof water eroding soil</li>

</ul>### Construction Factors
<ul><li><strong>Inadequate Footings</strong>: Too small for load</li>
<li><strong>Poor Concrete</strong>: Low quality or improper mix</li>
<li><strong>Fill Soil</strong>: Building on non-compacted fill</li>
<li><strong>Age</strong>: Natural deterioration over decades</li></ul>

<h2 id="how-much-settlement-is-too-much">How Much Settlement Is Too Much?</h2>
### Acceptable Settlement
<ul><li><strong>1/4 inch or less</strong>: Monitor annually</li>
<li><strong>Uniform settlement</strong>: Less concerning if even</li>

</ul>### Concerning Settlement
<ul><li><strong>1/2 inch differential</strong>: Requires evaluation</li>
<li><strong>Active movement</strong>: Ongoing changes</li>
<li><strong>Functional problems</strong>: Doors/windows affected</li>

</ul>### Critical Settlement
<ul><li><strong>1 inch or more</strong>: Immediate action needed</li>
<li><strong>Rapid progression</strong>: Worsening monthly</li>
<li><strong>Structural damage</strong>: Wall/ceiling separation</li></ul>
