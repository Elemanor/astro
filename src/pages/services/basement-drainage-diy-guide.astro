  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum slope required for basement drainage?",
      "answer": "Ontario Building Code requires minimum 1% slope (1/8 inch per foot), but 2% (1/4 inch per foot) is recommended for better flow. Never exceed 4% slope as pipes can separate. Consistent slope throughout the entire run is critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should drainage pipe holes face up or down?",
      "answer": "Holes MUST face DOWN, not up. This is the most common DIY mistake. Water enters through the gravel bed below, not from above. Holes facing up will clog immediately with sediment. Position pipes with two rows of holes at 4 and 8 o'clock."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use corrugated black pipe for basement drainage?",
      "answer": "No. Corrugated flexible pipe is not code-compliant for permanent basement drainage. It crushes easily, clogs frequently, and has poor flow rates. Use only rigid PVC pipe - 4 inch perforated for drainage, solid for discharge lines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of gravel should I use around drainage pipes?",
      "answer": "Use 3/4 inch (19mm) clear stone only. Never use crusher run or any gravel with fines - they'll clog your system. You need 6 inches of clear stone below the pipe and 6 inches above. This is not the place to save money."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for basement drainage work?",
      "answer": "Yes, most drainage work requires a plumbing permit. This includes new floor drains, sump pit installation, and perimeter drainage systems. Permits ensure code compliance and protect you during resale. Work without permits may void insurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I connect drainage to my sump pump?",
      "answer": "Drainage pipes should enter the sump pit through properly sized holes cut 4-6 inches below the rim. Maintain slope right to the pit. Use rubber grommets to seal penetrations. Never connect drainage directly to the pump."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's required for inspection to pass?",
      "answer": "Inspectors check: proper pipe size (4 inch minimum), consistent slope (1% minimum), purple primer on all PVC joints, approved materials, proper support, accessible cleanouts, and backwater valves where required. Test your system before inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I discharge my sump pump into the floor drain?",
      "answer": "No, this is illegal. Sump pumps cannot discharge to sanitary sewers. They must discharge outside, 10 feet minimum from foundation, or to storm sewers where permitted. Connecting to floor drains can cause sewage backups and hefty fines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How deep should interior perimeter drains be installed?",
      "answer": "Interior drains must be installed at or slightly below the footing bottom to capture water before it enters under the slab. This typically means 12-16 inches below basement floor level. Installing too shallow misses water."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is a backwater valve required?",
      "answer": "Backwater valves are required for any fixture below street level or in areas prone to sewer backup. This includes most basement floor drains and plumbing fixtures. They prevent sewage from backing up into your basement during heavy rains."
