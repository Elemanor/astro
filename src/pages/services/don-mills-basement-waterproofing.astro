  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What makes Don Mills homes different for waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Don Mills homes were built with innovative 1950s-60s construction techniques including radiant floor heating, unique foundation designs, and experimental materials. These require specialized knowledge to waterproof effectively while preserving their mid-century modern features and architectural integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work around radiant heating in basement floors?",
      "answer": "Yes, we specialize in protecting radiant heating systems during waterproofing. Our techniques locate heating pipes, work around them safely, and often improve system efficiency by better moisture management. We've never damaged a radiant system in hundreds of Don Mills projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will waterproofing affect my home's heritage value?",
      "answer": "Our solutions are designed to preserve and enhance heritage value. We use reversible techniques where possible, maintain architectural integrity, and provide documentation that supports heritage applications. Many clients see increased value from properly protected vintage homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle Don Mills' unique foundation designs?",
      "answer": "Each Don Mills home was somewhat experimental, so we research your specific construction details and adapt our approach accordingly. We understand the original engineering concepts and work with them rather than against them, ensuring solutions that complement the original design."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the large basement windows common in Don Mills?",
      "answer": "Don Mills' large basement windows are a signature feature we preserve. We create custom window well solutions that maintain natural light while providing proper drainage. Our systems integrate with the mid-century design aesthetic while providing modern protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work within heritage guidelines?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We're experienced with heritage requirements and work closely with heritage consultants when needed. Our solutions typically qualify as maintenance rather than alteration, but we ensure all work respects heritage values and guidelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does work take in Don Mills homes?",
      "answer": "Interior systems typically take 3-5 days, accounting for the careful work required around vintage systems. Exterior projects take 5-8 days with extra time for architectural protection. We work efficiently while maintaining the high standards these special homes deserve."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with architects and heritage consultants?",
      "answer": "Yes, we frequently collaborate with architects specializing in mid-century homes and heritage consultants. We provide technical input for restoration projects and can coordinate our work with larger renovation efforts to ensure integrated solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty applies to vintage homes?",
      "answer": "Our lifetime transferable warranty fully covers Don Mills homes, adapted for their specific construction. We guarantee our systems will work with vintage construction methods while providing modern protection levels. Documentation supports heritage and resale value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help preserve other mid-century features?",
      "answer": "While waterproofing is our specialty, we often identify and help preserve other mid-century features during our work. We maintain relationships with specialists in vintage systems and can provide referrals for comprehensive mid-century home restoration."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle the mature landscaping?",
      "answer": "Don Mills' mature landscaping is part of its heritage character. We use specialized techniques to work around established trees and plants, coordinate with landscape historians when needed, and ensure restoration maintains the original design intent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer financing for heritage home improvements?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer flexible financing including programs specifically for heritage property owners. We understand these homes require specialized care and work to make proper maintenance affordable. Some improvements may qualify for heritage tax credits."
