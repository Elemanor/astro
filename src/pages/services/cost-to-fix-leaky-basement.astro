  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the average cost to fix a leaky basement in Toronto?",
      "answer": "The average cost to fix a leaky basement ranges from $3,000-8,000 for interior solutions and $10,000-20,000 for exterior waterproofing. Simple crack repairs cost $500-1,500, while comprehensive systems addressing multiple issues can reach $25,000. Most homeowners spend $5,000-12,000 for lasting solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do basement leak repair costs vary so much?",
      "answer": "Costs vary based on the leak source (crack, window well, floor seepage), severity (minor drip vs. flooding), chosen solution (interior vs. exterior), basement condition (finished vs. unfinished), and urgency (emergency vs. planned). Each basement requires custom solutions affecting price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth paying more for exterior waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Exterior waterproofing costs 2-3x more but stops water at the source, lasts longer, and adds more home value. It's worth it for severe problems, chronic leaks, or when selling soon. Interior solutions work well for moderate issues and offer better value for finished basements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I fix a leaky basement myself to save money?",
      "answer": "DIY fixes like waterproof paint or hydraulic cement rarely provide lasting solutions and often fail within months. Professional repairs cost more initially but include warranties, proper diagnosis, and proven solutions. DIY attempts can make proper repairs more expensive later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does insurance cover leaky basement repairs?",
      "answer": "Insurance typically covers sudden water damage (burst pipes, storm flooding) but not gradual seepage or maintenance issues. Sewer backup requires additional coverage. Document all damage immediately and check your policy specifics. Most waterproofing is considered maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I finance expensive basement repairs?",
      "answer": "Options include: home equity loans, 0% financing programs (12-18 months), payment plans with contractors, insurance claims for covered damage, government subsidies (up to $3,400 for flood prevention), and phased repairs spreading costs over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I don't fix my leaky basement?",
      "answer": "Delaying repairs leads to: mold growth ($2,000-10,000 to remove), foundation damage ($5,000-50,000), ruined belongings, health issues, 10-25% property value loss, and repairs costing 20-50% more each year delayed. Water damage compounds quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I need crack injection or full waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Crack injection works for isolated, non-structural cracks without other water issues. Full waterproofing is needed for multiple cracks, floor seepage, high water tables, or recurring problems. Professional assessment determines the right solution for lasting results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in professional leak repair costs?",
      "answer": "Professional repairs include: diagnostic inspection, source identification, appropriate repair method, quality materials, skilled labor, cleanup, warranty coverage, and follow-up service. Quotes should detail all components. Beware suspiciously low quotes missing key elements."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to fix a leaky basement?",
      "answer": "The best time is immediately when leaks are discovered, before damage worsens. For planned repairs, late summer/fall offers dry conditions and contractor availability. Spring has highest demand and prices. Winter repairs possible but may cost more."
