  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What is a drain tile system and how does it work?",
      "answer": "A drain tile system is a network of perforated pipes installed around your foundation to collect and redirect groundwater away from your home. Modern drain tiles use corrugated plastic pipes with holes that allow water to enter while keeping soil out. The system relies on gravity to direct water to a collection point like a sump pump or storm sewer connection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between drain tile, French drain, and weeping tile?",
      "answer": "These terms are often used interchangeably in Toronto, but there are subtle differences: Drain tile refers to the perforated pipes themselves, French drains include the gravel bed and pipes working together, Weeping tile is the traditional Toronto term for foundation drainage. All describe systems that collect and redirect water from around foundations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does drain tile installation cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Drain tile installation costs vary based on system type and home size: Interior systems: $8,000-12,000 for typical basements, Exterior systems: $12,000-20,000 with excavation, Replacement of existing weeping tile: $10,000-15,000. Factors affecting cost include basement perimeter, soil conditions, access, and connection requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do modern drain tile systems last?",
      "answer": "Modern drain tile systems using corrugated plastic pipe last 50+ years when properly installed. Our systems include filter fabric to prevent clogging, proper slopes for flow, and quality connections. We provide lifetime warranties because we're confident in the durability of modern materials and professional installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need interior or exterior drain tile installation?",
      "answer": "The choice depends on your specific situation: Interior drain tile is more cost-effective, works year-round, and doesn't require landscaping disruption. Exterior systems provide comprehensive foundation protection but cost more and require excavation. Many homes benefit from both systems working together for maximum protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can drain tile be installed in winter in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Interior drain tile can be installed year-round since work is done inside the basement. Exterior installations are weather-dependent and typically scheduled for warmer months when excavation is practical. We can provide emergency interior solutions during winter and schedule exterior work for spring."

          "Our 1970s home had the original clay weeping tiles that were completely clogged. DrySpace installed 
          a modern interior drain tile system that has kept our basement perfectly dry for four years. 
          The difference is night and day - no more spring flooding!"

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="How do I know if I need drain tile installation?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Signs include: basement water infiltration, musty odors, efflorescence on walls, foundation cracks, or an aging/failed existing drainage system. A professional assessment can determine if drain tile is the right solution.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Can drain tile be added to existing homes?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Absolutely! Interior drain tile can be installed in most existing basements. We excavate a trench around the perimeter, install the system, and restore the floor. Minimal disruption to your daily life.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="What maintenance do drain tile systems require?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Modern drain tile systems require minimal maintenance. Annual sump pump testing, keeping gutters clean, and periodic inspection of discharge points. We provide maintenance guides and annual service options.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="How is drain tile different from a sump pump?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Drain tile collects water from around your foundation, while sump pumps remove collected water. They work together - drain tile gathers the water, sump pumps discharge it. Both are typically needed for complete protection.</p>
