  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "How much is the City of Toronto sump pump rebate?",
      "answer": "The City of Toronto offers up to $1,750 for sump pump installation through the Basement Flooding Protection Subsidy Program. The rebate covers 80% of installation costs up to the maximum. You can combine this with a backwater valve rebate for up to $3,400 total."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who qualifies for Toronto's sump pump rebate?",
      "answer": "Toronto residential property owners qualify, including single-family homes, semis, and townhouses. The property must be within Toronto boundaries, the sump pump must be permanently installed by a licensed contractor, and you cannot have received a previous rebate for the same device."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I apply for the basement flooding subsidy?",
      "answer": "Apply online at Toronto.ca within 60 days of installation. Submit itemized invoices, proof of payment, before/after photos, and permit documentation. The City reviews applications in 4-6 weeks, with rebate cheques issued in 8-12 weeks after approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install the sump pump myself and get the rebate?",
      "answer": "No, DIY installations do not qualify for the rebate. The sump pump must be installed by a licensed plumber or contractor to ensure code compliance and proper installation. The City requires professional invoices as part of the application."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the sump pump rebate cover?",
      "answer": "The rebate covers the sump pump unit, pit installation, discharge piping, check valve, electrical connection, concrete work, and labor. It can also include battery backup systems and water alarms. The rebate does not cover DIY labor or finishing work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get rebates for both sump pump and backwater valve?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can combine rebates for maximum flood protection. Installing both a sump pump ($1,750) and backwater valve ($1,750) can get you up to $3,400 in total rebates. Many contractors recommend both for comprehensive protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the rebate process take?",
      "answer": "The complete rebate process takes 12-18 weeks: Submit application within 60 days of installation, City review takes 4-6 weeks, and rebate cheques are mailed 8-12 weeks after approval. Some applications process faster if documentation is complete."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do condos qualify for the sump pump rebate?",
      "answer": "Individual condo units do not qualify as the building's flood protection is the condominium corporation's responsibility. However, condo corporations may be eligible for commercial flood protection programs. Townhouse condos may qualify if individually owned."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my sump pump installation costs less than $1,750?",
      "answer": "The rebate covers 80% of actual costs up to $1,750 maximum. If your installation costs $2,000, you receive $1,600. If it costs $1,500, you receive $1,200. Only installations costing $2,187.50 or more receive the full $1,750."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the rebate cover sump pump replacement?",
      "answer": "The rebate only covers new installations or replacement of failed sump pumps. Upgrading a working pump doesn't qualify. If your existing pump has failed, keep documentation of the failure to support your rebate application."
