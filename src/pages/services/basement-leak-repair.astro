Professional assessment prevents minor problems from becoming major damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between basement leak repair and waterproofing?",
      "answer": "Basement leak repair fixes specific water entry points like cracks or failed seals. Waterproofing provides comprehensive protection against all potential water sources through drainage systems, membranes, and vapor barriers. Many homes need both - repair for immediate problems and waterproofing for long-term protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does basement leak repair take in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Emergency stabilization happens within 2-6 hours. Simple crack repairs take 1 day, interior waterproofing requires 2-3 days, and exterior solutions need 3-7 days. Weather, access, and permit requirements affect timelines. We provide detailed schedules during estimate process and coordinate around your needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will basement leak repair work in Toronto's clay soil?",
      "answer": "Yes, our repairs specifically address Toronto's challenging clay soil conditions.

Our 25-year Toronto experience ensures repairs withstand local soil conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What basement leak repair method lasts longest?",
      "answer": "Exterior waterproofing provides maximum longevity (25+ years) by addressing water at its source. Interior systems last 15-25 years with proper maintenance. Crack injection lasts 10-20 years for structural repairs. We recommend solutions based on your specific conditions, budget, and longevity requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can basement leak repair be done in winter in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Yes, interior methods work year-round including crack injection, drainage systems, and sump pump installation. Exterior work requires temperatures above -5°C for proper curing. We maintain heated work areas and use cold-weather materials when necessary. Emergency repairs happen regardless of weather conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does basement leak repair cost compared to water damage?",
      "answer": "Professional repair ranges from $500-$25,000 depending on scope. Basement flood damage averages $15,000-$30,000 including contents, flooring, drywall, and mold remediation. Repeat flooding costs multiply rapidly. Most repairs pay for themselves by preventing just one flood incident."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do basement leak repairs come with warranties?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide lifetime warranties on most repairs including crack injection and waterproofing systems. Emergency repairs carry 1-year warranties. Warranties cover both materials and labor, are transferable to new owners, and include annual inspection rights. Warranty terms vary by repair type and are detailed in contracts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will insurance cover my basement leak repair?",
      "answer": "Sudden water events (burst pipes, storm backup) often qualify for coverage. Gradual seepage and maintenance issues typically don't qualify. We document all conditions, coordinate with adjusters, and provide direct billing when possible. Emergency mitigation services usually receive coverage regardless of cause."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you find hidden basement leaks?",
      "answer": "We use thermal imaging cameras, calibrated moisture meters, dye testing, and video inspection equipment. These tools detect water sources behind walls, in drainage systems, and from remote entry points. Comprehensive diagnosis identifies all water sources before repairs begin, preventing missed problems."

</ul>### Risks of DIY Basement Leak Repair:
<ul><li><strong>Inadequate diagnosis</strong> missing hidden water sources</li>
