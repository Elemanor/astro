    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to a basement leak emergency?",
      "answer": "We provide 24/7 emergency response with an average arrival time of 30 minutes within Toronto. Our emergency technicians carry water extraction equipment, temporary leak repair materials, and advanced detection tools. We understand that basement leaks can cause thousands in damage within hours, so immediate response is critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does basement leak repair cost in Toronto?",
      "answer": "Basement leak repair costs vary based on the source and severity: Simple crack injection: $300-800, Foundation wall repairs: $500-1,500, Emergency water extraction: $200-600 per hour, Comprehensive waterproofing: $3,000-8,000. We provide upfront pricing and work directly with insurance companies when applicable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will insurance cover my basement leak repair?",
      "answer": "Coverage depends on the leak cause and your policy. Sudden pipe bursts are typically covered, while seepage from poor waterproofing may not be. We work directly with insurance companies, provide detailed documentation, and help maximize your claim. Our reports meet insurance adjuster requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you find hidden leaks behind finished walls?",
      "answer": "Yes, we use thermal imaging cameras, moisture meters, and acoustic detection to locate hidden leaks without destructive investigation. Our advanced equipment can detect moisture behind drywall, under flooring, and within concrete walls. This prevents unnecessary demolition and reduces repair costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between emergency repair and permanent solutions?",
      "answer": "Emergency repairs stop immediate water damage using temporary patches, sealants, or pumping. Permanent solutions address the root cause through proper waterproofing, drainage installation, or structural repairs. We provide both: immediate damage control followed by lasting repairs with lifetime warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent future basement leaks?",
      "answer": "Prevention involves addressing root causes: Foundation crack injection for structural leaks, proper drainage systems for hydrostatic pressure, exterior waterproofing for groundwater infiltration, improved ventilation for condensation issues. We provide comprehensive solutions that prevent recurring problems."

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Should I try to fix a basement leak myself?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Small surface leaks might seem manageable, but most basement leaks indicate deeper issues requiring professional diagnosis. DIY repairs often fail because they don't address root causes, potentially causing more expensive damage later.</p>
        </QuestionAnswer>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="How long does emergency leak repair take?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Emergency response typically takes 1-3 hours to stop active leaks and extract water. Permanent repairs are scheduled within 1-3 days. Complex issues requiring excavation may take longer.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Can you repair leaks in finished basements?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Yes, we use minimally invasive techniques including injection through small drill holes. Our advanced detection equipment locates leaks without extensive demolition of finished areas.</p>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="What if the leak comes back?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>All our repairs include lifetime warranties. If water infiltration recurs through the same location, we return at no charge to make it right. Our permanent solutions address root causes, not just symptoms.</p>
