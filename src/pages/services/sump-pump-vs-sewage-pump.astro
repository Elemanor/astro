  serviceFaqs: [
    {
      "question": "What's the main difference between a sump pump and sewage pump?",
      "answer": "Sump pumps handle clean groundwater and discharge it outside or to storm sewers. Sewage pumps handle toilet waste and greywater, grinding solids and pumping them to your sanitary sewer. Using the wrong pump is illegal and dangerous."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use a sump pump for my basement bathroom?",
      "answer": "No! Sump pumps cannot handle sewage or solids. They'll clog immediately with toilet waste. You need a sewage pump (ejector pump) with grinding capability designed specifically for bathroom waste."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does each pump discharge water?",
      "answer": "Sump pumps discharge outside your home (10+ feet from foundation) or to storm sewers where allowed. Sewage pumps MUST discharge to your sanitary sewer line - it's illegal to pump sewage outside or into storm sewers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need both pumps in my basement?",
      "answer": "Many finished basements need both: a sump pump to manage groundwater and prevent flooding, and a sewage pump if you have a bathroom below your main sewer line. They serve completely different purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which pump costs more to install?",
      "answer": "Sewage pumps typically cost more: $2,500-8,000 installed vs $1,200-4,000 for sump pumps. Sewage pumps require sealed tanks, venting to roof, complex plumbing connections, and professional installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is professional installation important?",
      "answer": "Professional installation ensures proper sizing, code compliance, and reliable operation. Sewage pumps especially require professional installation due to health hazards, venting requirements, and plumbing codes. Even sump pumps benefit from professional installation to ensure optimal performance and warranty coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do these pumps last?",
      "answer": "Sump pumps typically last 7-10 years with regular use and maintenance. Sewage pumps last 7-15 years depending on usage. Both require annual professional maintenance for optimal lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I connect my sump pump to the sewer?",
      "answer": "This is illegal in most municipalities including Toronto. You face heavy fines, contribute to sewer overflow during storms, and may have insurance claims denied. Sump water must go to appropriate storm drainage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do sewage pumps smell?",
      "answer": "Properly installed sewage pumps with sealed tanks and correct venting shouldn't smell. Odors indicate problems: poor seals, blocked vents, or maintenance needs. The system should be completely sealed and vented to your roof."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size pump do I need?",
      "answer": "For sump pumps: 1/3 HP handles most residential needs, 1/2 HP for high water volume. For sewage pumps: 1/2 HP minimum for half bath, 3/4 HP for full bath, 1 HP for multiple fixtures or apartments."
