// Service FAQs - avoiding colons in answers
const serviceFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What exactly is a sump pump and how does it work?",
    answer: "A sump pump is an automatic water removal device installed in your basement's lowest point (sump pit). When groundwater or surface water enters the pit, a float switch activates the pump motor, which forces water up through discharge pipes and away from your foundation. The system cycles automatically - pumping when water levels rise, shutting off when levels drop. It's your home's first line of defense against basement flooding, operating 24/7 to prevent water damage."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the main types of sump pumps available?",
    answer: "There are four main types - 1) Submersible pumps (most popular) - sit underwater in the pit, quieter and more efficient. 2) Pedestal pumps - motor above water, less expensive but noisier. 3) Battery backup pumps - activate during power outages when flooding risk is highest. 4) Water-powered backup pumps - use city water pressure, no electricity needed. Most Toronto homes benefit from submersible primary pumps with battery backup for complete protection."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if I need a sump pump in my Toronto home?",
    answer: "Key warning signs include - water stains or dampness in basement, musty odors, white chalky deposits (efflorescence) on walls, neighbors having sump pumps, living in high-risk areas (The Beaches, Don Valley, Etobicoke South), planning basement renovations, or insurance requirements. Toronto's clay soil, high water table, and extreme weather make sump pumps essential for most properties. Even minor moisture indicates groundwater pressure that will worsen over time."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does sump pump installation cost in Toronto?",
    answer: "Professional sump pump installation in Toronto ranges from $1,200-$4,500 depending on system complexity. Basic installations start around $1,200, standard systems with battery backup cost $2,800-$3,500, and premium systems for challenging conditions can reach $4,500. We provide transparent, no-surprise pricing with detailed written estimates. Emergency installations cost 20-30% more due to urgency. Financing options available with 0% interest for 12 months."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I really need a battery backup sump pump in Toronto?",
    answer: "Absolutely yes if you have a finished basement or would suffer significant damage from flooding. Toronto's storm patterns often cause power outages exactly when pumps are needed most. Ice storms, summer thunderstorms, and grid overload during peak demand create power failures during flooding events. Battery backup systems automatically activate during outages, providing 4-8 hours of pumping capacity. Many Toronto insurance companies now require backup systems for basement coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "What maintenance does a sump pump need?",
    answer: "Sump pumps need monthly testing during wet seasons and annual professional maintenance. Monthly - pour water in pit to test operation, check discharge flow, verify backup battery status. Annual professional service includes pump cleaning, float switch testing, check valve inspection, battery replacement, and discharge line verification. Our maintenance customers experience 90% fewer emergency failures and their pumps last 40% longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I install a sump pump myself or do I need a professional?",
    answer: "While DIY installation is possible, 90% of sump pump failures result from improper installation. Professional installation ensures correct pump sizing, optimal pit placement, code-compliant electrical work, and proper discharge routing. Toronto building codes require permits for most installations. Our licensed technicians guarantee proper installation with lifetime warranty on workmanship. DIY mistakes often cost more to fix than professional installation would have cost initially."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do sump pumps last in Toronto's climate?",
    answer: "Quality sump pumps last 7-10 years with proper maintenance in Toronto's freeze-thaw climate. Premium cast iron pumps can last 10-15 years. Cheaper pumps typically fail in 3-5 years. Toronto's clay soil and seasonal water variations affect pump lifespan - pumps that run constantly wear faster. Our maintenance program extends pump life by 40% through preventive care and early problem detection."
