        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">Why Toronto Homes Need Professional Waterproofing</h2>
        
        <div class="prose max-w-none">
          <p>Toronto's unique climate and geographical conditions create the perfect storm for basement water problems. Understanding these challenges helps homeowners appreciate why professional waterproofing isn't just an option - it's essential protection for your investment.</p>

          <h3>Toronto's Freeze-Thaw Cycles and Foundation Impact</h3>
          <p>The Greater Toronto Area experiences some of Canada's most dramatic temperature fluctuations. Winter temperatures can plummet to -20°C, while summer peaks reach 35°C. This constant expansion and contraction creates tremendous stress on foundation materials.</p>
          
          <p>Concrete foundations expand and contract with temperature changes. Over years, this movement creates hairline cracks that worsen during freeze-thaw cycles. Water enters these cracks, freezes, and expands with tremendous force - literally splitting your foundation further apart. What starts as a minor crack becomes a major waterproofing emergency.</p>

          <h3>Clay Soil Challenges Specific to the GTA</h3>
          <p>Much of the Greater Toronto Area sits on clay-rich soil deposited by ancient Lake Iroquois. This soil type creates unique waterproofing challenges that many contractors don't fully understand.</p>
          
          <p>Clay soil absorbs water slowly but retains it for extended periods. During Toronto's wet springs, clay becomes saturated and expands significantly. This expansion puts enormous pressure against foundation walls - pressure that can crack concrete and force water through the smallest gaps.</p>

          <h3>Aging Infrastructure in Older Toronto Neighborhoods</h3>
          <p>Toronto's housing stock includes thousands of homes built before modern waterproofing standards existed. Century homes, post-war bungalows, and homes built through the 1970s often lack adequate foundation protection.</p>
          
          <p>Older homes typically have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stone or block foundations with mortar joints that deteriorate over time</li>
            <li>Weeping tile systems made from clay or concrete that crack and clog</li>
            <li>Inadequate exterior waterproofing or none at all</li>
            <li>Foundation designs that don't account for modern drainage standards</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>High Water Table Areas Throughout the GTA</h3>
          <p>The Greater Toronto Area's proximity to Lake Ontario and extensive watershed creates high water table conditions in many neighborhoods. These areas require specialized waterproofing approaches that many contractors don't understand.</p>
          
          <p>High water table neighborhoods include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Beaches and East Toronto</strong> - Close to Lake Ontario with seasonal water table fluctuations</li>
            <li><strong>Etobicoke waterfront areas</strong> - Mimico Creek and Humber River influence groundwater levels</li>
            <li><strong>Don Valley communities</strong> - Don River watershed creates year-round high water conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Rouge Valley areas</strong> - Rouge River system affects eastern Scarborough and Pickering</li>
            <li><strong>Mississauga Credit River areas</strong> - Credit River watershed influences groundwater</li>
            <li><strong>Vaughan and Richmond Hill</strong> - Holland River watershed creates seasonal high water tables</li>
          </ul>
