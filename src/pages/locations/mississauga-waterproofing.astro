  // FAQs
  localFaqs: [
    {
      question: "How much does basement waterproofing cost in Mississauga?",
      answer: "Costs range from $3,500-$8,000 for interior systems and $12,000-$25,000 for exterior waterproofing. Factors include your neighborhood (Port Credit properties near the lake often need more extensive work), foundation type, and severity of water issues. We provide free assessments and can help you access up to $3,000 in Peel Region rebates."
    },
    {
      question: "What rebates are available for Mississauga homeowners?",
      answer: "Peel Region offers several rebates: up to $1,500 for backwater valves, $750 for sump pumps with battery backup, and up to $3,000 total for qualifying flood prevention measures. Seniors and residents with disabilities may qualify for an additional 15% assistance. We handle all rebate paperwork as part of our service."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my Mississauga basement leaking?",
      answer: "Common causes in Mississauga include: expansive clay soil (especially in Meadowvale/Erin Mills), high water tables near Lake Ontario (Port Credit/Lakeview), aging foundations in older neighborhoods (Streetsville/Cooksville), and overwhelmed storm sewers causing backups. Our free inspection identifies your specific issues."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve all Mississauga neighborhoods?",
      answer: "Yes! We serve all Mississauga areas including Port Credit, Streetsville, Meadowvale, Erin Mills, Square One, Cooksville, Lakeview, Clarkson, Lorne Park, Dixie, Malton, and Churchill Meadows. Our average response time is 45 minutes anywhere in Mississauga."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does waterproofing take in Mississauga?",
      answer: "Timeline depends on the solution: interior waterproofing takes 2-3 days, exterior waterproofing 4-5 days, crack repairs same day, and sump pump installation 1 day. We work year-round and coordinate with Mississauga's building department for any required permits."
    },
    {
      question: "Is basement waterproofing worth it in Mississauga?",
      answer: "Absolutely. With Mississauga property values averaging $1.2M+, protecting your foundation is critical. Waterproofing prevents costly damage, maintains property value, enables basement finishing, and often pays for itself through rebates and prevented damage. Many insurance companies also offer premium reductions."
