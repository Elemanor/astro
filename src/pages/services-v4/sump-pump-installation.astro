    {
      question: "What exactly is a sump pump and how does it work?",
      answer: "A sump pump is an automatic water removal device installed in your basement's lowest point (sump pit). When groundwater or surface water enters the pit, a float switch activates the pump motor, which forces water up through discharge pipes and away from your foundation. The system cycles automatically - pumping when water levels rise, shutting off when levels drop. It's your home's first line of defense against basement flooding, operating 24/7 to prevent water damage."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the main types of sump pumps available?",
      answer: "There are four main types: 1) Submersible pumps (most popular) - sit underwater in the pit, quieter and more efficient. 2) Pedestal pumps - motor above water, less expensive but noisier. 3) Battery backup pumps - activate during power outages when flooding risk is highest. 4) Water-powered backup pumps - use city water pressure, no electricity needed. Most Toronto homes benefit from submersible primary pumps with battery backup for complete protection."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I need a sump pump in my Toronto home?",
      answer: "Key warning signs include: water stains or dampness in basement, musty odors, white chalky deposits (efflorescence) on walls, neighbors having sump pumps, living in high-risk areas (The Beaches, Don Valley, Etobicoke South), planning basement renovations, or insurance requirements. Toronto's clay soil, high water table, and extreme weather make sump pumps essential for most properties. Even minor moisture indicates groundwater pressure that will worsen over time."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does sump pump installation cost in Toronto?",
      answer: "Professional sump pump installation in Toronto ranges from $1,200-$4,500 depending on system complexity. Basic installations start around $1,200, standard systems with battery backup cost $2,800-$3,500, and premium systems for challenging conditions can reach $4,500. We provide transparent, no-surprise pricing with detailed written estimates. Emergency installations cost 20-30% more due to urgency. Financing options available with 0% interest for 12 months."

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Do I really need a battery backup sump pump?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Absolutely yes if you have a finished basement or would suffer significant damage from flooding. Toronto's storm patterns often cause power outages exactly when pumps are needed most. Battery backup systems provide 4-8 hours of protection during outages.</p>
        </QuestionAnswer>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="How long do sump pumps last in Toronto's climate?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Quality pumps last 7-10 years with proper maintenance in Toronto's freeze-thaw climate. Premium cast iron pumps can last 10-15 years. Our maintenance program extends pump life by 40% through preventive care.</p>
        </QuestionAnswer>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="What size sump pump do I need for my home?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>Pump size depends on basement area and water volume. Small homes need 25-35 GPM, average homes require 35-50 GPM, and large homes need 50-75 GPM. We provide professional assessment to determine exact requirements.</p>
        </QuestionAnswer>

        <QuestionAnswer 
          question="Can I install a sump pump myself?"
          variant="card"
        >
          <p>While DIY is possible, 90% of pump failures result from improper installation. Professional installation ensures correct sizing, code compliance, and reliable operation. DIY mistakes often cost more to fix than professional installation.</p>
