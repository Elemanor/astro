      question: "How effective is interior waterproofing?",
      answer: "Interior waterproofing is highly effective when properly installed. Our systems remove 99.9% of water that enters, work in all weather conditions, last 30+ years with minimal maintenance, and come with lifetime transferable warranty. While exterior waterproofing stops water before entry, interior systems effectively manage any water that does get through."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does interior waterproofing cost in Toronto?",
      answer: "Interior waterproofing Toronto typically costs 40-60% less than exterior waterproofing solutions while providing excellent protection. Basement waterproofing cost for interior systems ranges from $70-150 per linear foot. For detailed cost breakdowns, please see our comprehensive basement waterproofing cost guide."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does installation take?",
      answer: "Most interior waterproofing projects take 2-3 days for small basements (< 1000 sq ft), 3-4 days for average basements (1000-1500 sq ft), and 4-5 days for large basements (> 1500 sq ft). We work cleanly and efficiently. You can remain in your home during installation."
    },
    {
      question: "Will interior waterproofing damage my finished basement?",
      answer: "We specialize in working with finished basements with minimal removal of finishes (typically just bottom 2 feet), precise cutting to preserve most walls, clean installation with dust control, and careful planning to often save flooring. Many clients combine waterproofing with planned renovations for best results."
