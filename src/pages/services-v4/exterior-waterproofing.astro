      question: "Is exterior waterproofing worth the cost?",
      answer: "Exterior waterproofing is an investment that pays dividends: adds 10-15% to home value, prevents $20,000+ in water damage, protects foundation integrity, creates usable basement space, and comes with lifetime warranty. For homes with serious water issues or valuable finished basements, exterior waterproofing is always worth it."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does exterior waterproofing cost in Toronto?",
      answer: "Exterior waterproofing Toronto costs typically range from $300-500 per linear foot, making it a significant investment. The cost varies based on excavation requirements, access, soil type, and additional repairs. While more expensive than interior solutions, it provides maximum protection and foundation preservation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does exterior waterproofing take?",
      answer: "Project timeline depends on scope: Single wall takes 3-5 days, full house takes 1-2 weeks, and complex projects take 2-3 weeks. Weather can affect timeline. We provide detailed schedules and work efficiently to minimize disruption."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my landscaping?",

        >
          <p>For homes with serious water issues, exterior waterproofing is always worth it. It adds 10-15% to home value, prevents tens of thousands in water damage, and provides lifetime protection. The investment typically pays for itself within 5-7 years.</p>
